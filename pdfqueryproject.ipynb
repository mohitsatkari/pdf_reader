What that \\nBible and this bible have in common is wisdom. Wanna learn how to love \\nthv neighbor? Read that one. Wanna learn how to make thy neighbor \\nlaugh? Read this one. This version of the bible will show you how to dis\\xad\\ncover your originality, craft it, and turn your sense of humor into a mon-\\neymaking comedy career—no joke! The Comedy Bible—don\\'t be fanny \\nwithout it. \\nIf you\\'re serious about comedy, then here\\'s whv you need this book: \\n• Because you hear others say, \"Hey, you\\'re fanny vou should be a come\\xad\\ndian.\" \\n• Because vou want to quit your day job and make money being funny. \\n• Because you would like to turn those ideas jotted down on scraps of \\npaper into sitcom scripts. \\n• Because vou think that you\\'re as funny as the schmucks vou see on TV. \\n• Because sometimes when you see a new sitcom or hear a comic tell a joke \\nyou say, \"I thought of that!\" \\n• Because you think people are stealing your comedy ideas, and vou\\'d do \\nsomething about it but vou can\\'t get off the couch. Some of the funniest people I know are waiting tables, cleaning \\nhouses, temping in offices, and whining about their lack of success while \\nless gifted comics and writers are making millions. Why not you? No \\nmatter what your day job is now, you could make a living doing comedy, \\nalthough very seldom docs real success come over night. \\nEven the best comics started out doing something else. Jay Leno \\nstarted out as an auto mechanic. The late, brilliant Sam Kenison was a \\nCatholic priest before he started doing stand-up. Writer/producer Barry \\nKemp, Emmy-nominated writer of Taxi and producer/creator of Newhart \\nand Coach, started as an insurance salesman in Phoenix. Rodney Danger-\\nfield was selling house paint before he became famous—which might be \\nwhy he didn\\'t \"get no respect.\" \\nIf you have a talent for making people laugh, there are a lot of oppor\\xad\\ntunities for fun and profit just waiting for you. And a person can make it \\nin the funny business without ever getting onstage. Comics express them\\xad\\nselves in many different ways. Many, of course, do get onstage, acting and \\ndoing stand-up, but others write sitcoms, screenplays, and songs, while \\nothers express themselves through cartoons, advertising, and more. Peo\\xad\\nple who know the craft of comedy writing are pursued and paid well for \\ntheir talent. From politicians to manufacturers, everyone has got some\\xad\\nthing to sell, and comedy sells it best. It\\'s no wonder, then, that many \\npoliticians have a staff of comedy writers working for them so that they \\ndon\\'t become big jokes themselves. They know also that ideas presented \\nwith humor become the sound biles that make the six o\\'clock news. And \\nof course, advertisers know that commercials that make a jaded TV audi\\xad\\nence laugh will move merchandise more effectively than any other \\nmethod. Even Hallmark employs comedy writers to write their humorous \\ncards. \\nHumor can even get you dates. Just look at the personal ads—\"sense \\nof humor\" is the number one requirement of many people seeking a \\nmate. But the big question is, how do you go from being one of the guys \\nwho gets drunk at parties and lights his farts to being a Jim Carrey, who \\ngets paid over $50 million a year to light his farts? \\nAfter ten years of running comedy workshops, coaching over live \\nthousand comics, and doing stand-up at thousands of events myself, 1 \\nhave developed an understanding of what it takes to be successful in com\\xad\\nedy—and it isn\\'t luck, relatives in the business, or a boob job. Those \\nthings may get you in the door, but they aren\\'t going to make people \\nlaugh—unless, of course, it was a really bad boob job. What it takes to \\nmake it as a comic or as a comedy writer is a combination of talent and craft. If you have a gift for comedy, then 1 can show you how to shape \\nyour gift into the sort of \"funny\" that will get you noticed and paid. The \\nproof? After taking my eight-week course, many beginning stand-up \\ncomics have been signed, often after their first performance, by some of \\nthe biggest and most powerful agents, managers, and studios. And some \\nstand-up students who have gone on to become successful writers found \\nthat their scripts read more humorously and sold more easily because \\ndiey could pitch funny \\nOf course, just as there are specific things you can do to make your \\ncareer happen, there also are things that will kill and sabotage your suc\\xad\\ncess. This book will tell you which is which. Believe me, I know, because \\nI\\'ve done it all—the good, the bad, and the unfunny. \\nI have been very fortunate to make a living doing what I love most—com\\xad\\nedy. I\\'ve worked at only one nine-to-five job in my life—teaching theater \\nfor two years at a private boys\\' school in Los Angeles. Other than that, for \\ntwenty-five years I\\'ve made a living performing, writing, and teaching \\ncomedy (all of which is not bad for a twenty-nine-year-old). For the first \\nten years of my career I did clubs and television shows. At the height of \\nmy performing career I was on the tube even\\' week and on the road forty \\nweeks a vear as a headliner in comedy clubs and concert venues. I was \\nnominated lor Atlantic City\\'s Entertainer of the Year award for my per\\xad\\nformances ai Caesars Palace. I have produced and written television \\nshows. I\\'ve written books that have won awards (OK, one book that won \\none award), seen my film scripts optioned and my plays produced. \\nSometimes I look at the things I own and marvel: \"This outfit cost \\nme three jokes.\" \"This home cost me one script—but. ten drafts!\" After all \\nthese years, I still am amazed at being able to make a living off my sense \\nof humor. \\nBut this book is based only partially on my successes. In fact, it\\'s \\nbased mostly on my mistakes and failures. Like when I had too much \\nt\\'me in the greenroom before going on national TV and decided at the \\nast minute to throw all my material out the window and do something \\nnew—-and unfunny. Like the time I spent doing material that I didn\\'t \\nH-lieve in because I wanted to be what I thought was commercial. The \\ntone I didn\\'t sign with a major manager because I was seared of success. \\n\\'he time I finally had an audition with a top television producer and let \"When adults ask kids, \\'What do you want to be when you grow up?\\' they\\'re just \\nlooking for clues themselves.\" \\n—PAULA POUNDSTONE \\nThere are a lot of ways to make a living from comedy. You can per\\xad\\nform it, write it, draw it, or manage if. From the list below, check which \\nones you\\'re interested in or think you know you\\'re good at. \\nQ Stand-up comic \\nDepending on the quality of your act. you can work at comedy clubs, \\nhotels, concert venues, colleges, or corporate meetings, on cruise ships, at \\nopen mikes, or at your aunt Thelma\\'s eightieth birthday party. \\n-I Improviser \\nSketch TV shows such as Saturday Night Live and Mad TV scout impro-\\nVisers from improv troupes such as Second City (in Chicago and Toronto) \\nand the Groundlings (in Los Angeles), as well as improv festivals (Austin, \\nfexas, Montreal, Canada). Improvisers are in demand for acting and TV \\ncommercials as well as for voice-over work, feature animation, and game \\nshows. _) Commercial actor \\nFunny people who can add sizzle to ad copv are cast in high-paying TV \\ncommercials. \\nU Voice-over performer \\nComedy timing and technique are required in this field, which needs \\ncomics to add funny character voices to cartoons, TV commercials, and \\nfeature animation. \\nJ Warm-up for TV shows \\nMost TV shows hire a comic to warm up the live studio audience before \\nand during the taping of TV shows and infomercials. \\nD Radio comedy \\nFunny song parodies turned unknown \"Weird Al\" Yankovic into a \\nfamous and rich man. Radio stations buy prerecorded song parodies, \\nimpersonations, and other comedy bits produced by small production \\nhouses that specialize in creating this type of material. \\n• Radio talk show host \\nAs more talk shows fill the AM and FM airwaves, radio producers are \\nturning to comics to keep their listeners laughing and listening. \\n• Cruise ship entertainer \\nImagine doing your act for your grandmother—that\\'s the kind of act you \\nneed to work cruise ships. If you\\'ve got four different twenty-minute \\nclean sets and don\\'t mind living with your audience for a few weeks, then \\nthis could be for vou. \\n• Corporate humorist \\nIf you can make people laugh with clean material, then entertaining at \\ncorporate events might be just your thing. \\n• Customized stand-up material \\nSome stand-up comics who perform supplement their income by writing \\nfor other comics. And then there are those funny people who have never \\ndone stand-up themselves but who write it for others, such as funnyman \\nBruce Vilanch, who writes for Betle Midler and the Academy Awards show. \\n• TV sitcoms \\nComics are hired to staff sitcoms or develop sitcoms for stand-up comics \\nwho have development deals. Many of the most successful sitcoms are \\nbased on stand-up comedy acts. Stand-up comics Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld became billionaires when they turned their stand-up acts into \\none of the most successful sitcoms ever—Seinfeld. \\n• Punch-up \\nTV and film producers hire comics for the important job of punching up, \\nor adding laughs to, a script. \\n• Screcnwriting and directing \\nComedy directors often start their careers with live performances. Betty \\nThomas started in an improv troupe and went, on to direct features such \\nas Die Brady Bunch Movie. Tom Shadyac, director of Patch Adams, Liar, \\nLiar, and Tlie Nutty Professor, actually started out in my stand-up work\\xad\\nshop. Two years later, he directed his first feature. Ace Ventura. \\n• Literary writing \\n\"Funny\" can also translate into books, magazine articles, and newspaper \\ncolumns. George Carlin turned his unused stand-up material into the \\nbook Brain Droppings. Comedy director/screenwriter Nora Ephron (You\\'ve \\n(jot Mail, Sleepless in Seattle) wrote short funny magazine pieces that later \\nbecame a popular book, Mixed Nuts. Dave Barry expresses his \"funny\" in \\na nationally syndicated column and in books. \\n• Development and producing \\nFunny ideas often translate into projects for commercial TV and film. \\nPaul Reubens\\'s character Pee-wee Herman started out as a character in \\nan improv show at the Groundlings. It turned into an HBO special, two \\nfeature films, and an award-winning children\\'s TV series. \\n• Animation writing \\nAll major studios actively look for funny people to write and punch up \\ntheir TV and feature animation projects. Irene Mecchi began as a com\\xad\\nedy writer, writing comedy material for Lily Tomlin. Now she works for \\nDisney animation and was the screenwriter of Tlie Lion King. \\n• Internet work \\nBecause a good laugh can stop an Internet surfer at a Web site, compa\\xad\\nnies such as Excite, Yahoo!, and AOL hire comics to write catchy copy. \\nQ Speechwriting \\nMany CEOs and politicians turn to comedy writers to provide sound \\nbites so that they get noticed, win over their audiences, and don\\'t get \\nstuck with their foot in their mouth. \\n\"I know what they say about me—that I\\'m so stiff that racks buy their suits \\noff me.\" \\n—Al G0RE, 1998, WRITTEN BY MARK KATZ • Merchandising \\nrunny ideas can turn into funny products, such as Pet Rocks, screen \\nsavers, or greeting cards. Skyler Thomas, who started writing jokes in my \\nclass, put his jokes on T-shirts. They became major sellers and he now \\nruns a multimillion-dollar T-shirt business called Don\\'t Panic, with stores \\nthroughout America. \\n• Ad copy \\nWho do you think writes those funny bits in ads that gel your attention? \\nComedy writers. \\n\"Most relationships don\\'t last as long as the LA. Marathon.\" \\n—LA. BILLBOARD \\n• Managing and booking \\nMany agents and managers started by putting shows together for them\\xad\\nselves and ended up booking others. \\nRight now, of course, you don\\'t need to make a commitment to any \\nspecific comedy field. Actually, no matter which field of comedy you are \\ninterested in at the start of this book, be open to the possibility of shift\\xad\\ning winds. You might be totally committed to performing stand-up until \\nsomeone offers you a $50,000-a-year job writing funny ads for toilet \\ncleaners. It could happen. \\nYou might start off thinking you want to be a stand-up comic and end \\nup discovering thai you have a lot of ideas that can work as sitcoms. Billy \\nRiback started out doing stand-up at the Improv at $25 a night, and now he \\nproduces comedy TV shows making millions. Conan O\\'Brien and Garry \\nShandling were both sitcom writers before they became comedy stars. In \\n1978 David Letterman was a joke writer for Jimmie \"Dy-No-Mite\" Walker. \\nThe Zucker brothers and )itn Abrahams, who created and directed the \\nmovies Airplane!, Naked Gun, and Ghost, began their careers in a comedy \\nimprov troupe in Madison, Wisconsin, called Kentucky Fried Theater. \\nAnd then there\\'s Gary Coleman, who started off as a comedy actor star\\xad\\nring in his own sitcom and ended up as a security guard. Go figure! \\nThe various fields of comedy can morph into one another. Sometimes \\na comic\\'s act becomes the basis for a sitcom (Roseanne), or a screenplay becomes a sitcom (M*A*S*H, Suddenly Susan). Even jokes have become \\nmerchandise: Rosie O\\'Donnell\\'s slingshot toy has sold over 2 million \\nunits. \\nI became a stand-up comic thanks to United Airlines. I started off as \\na funny magician working at the Magic Castle in Hollywood—I levitated \\ncelery, sawed a man in half, and performed a death-defying escape from \\nmy grandmother\\'s girdle. United Airlines changed the course of my career \\nwhen I arrived in Cincinnati and my act arrived in Newark. That night I \\nwalked onstage without my tricks, without an act. I was so scared that 1 \\njust started babbling about what happened, and to my surprise, I got \\nlaughs. I then ranted about all the humiliations of my life and the laughs \\ngot bigger, and before I knew it, my twenty-minute set ended. It was then \\nthat I learned the biggest lesson about comedy: truth is funny and shows \\nup even when your luggage doesn\\'t. 1 became a stand-up comic, because \\nwhy schlepp around a bunch of props when people will pay you just for \\nyour ideas? Recently I\\'ve added to my work schedule by doing funny \\nmotivational speaking at Fortune 500 companies. Who knew? \\nThe bottom line is, funny people are not limited to one field oi com-\\nedv, and many of them overlap. For right now, you don\\'t need to know \\nwhat you want to be when you grow up—all you need is your sense of \\nhumor. But first, let\\'s make sure vou have one. Some people, no matter how hard they try, just aren\\'t funny. It takes a \\ncertain disposition to do comedy. So, how do you know if you have \\nthe right stuff? \\nCircle the answers that describe you best. \\nyes no Do you think that you\\'re funnier than most of the schmucks \\nyou see on TV? \\nyes no Every time you open your mouth, does an inner voice say, \"You \\nshould be writing this down\"—even during sex? \\nyes no Are you jealous of everyone who makes a living from comedy? \\nyes no Could you think of funny jokes even at a funeral? \\nyes no Do you ever think that you are the only sane one in your Crazy \\nfamily? \\nyes no When you get angry, do you get funny? \\nyes no Would you tell people your most embarrassing moments and \\ninadequacies if you could get a laugh? \\nyes no Do you notice the quirks of life that other people miss? \\nyes no Do you study the minute details of life, such as lint? yes no Do you sometimes imagine a future full of the improbable? \\nSuch as, \"What if men got pregnant?\" \"What if you were born \\nold and grew young?\" \\nyes no Do you think you look funny when you\\'re naked? \\nyes no Do you talk back to your television? \\nyes no Did you grow up in a family where few things were really dis\\xad\\ncussed and communication was at a minimum? \\nyes no Do \\\\ou imitate your family behind their back? \\nyes no Do you have opinions about everything? \\nyes no Do you get accused of exaggerating? \\nGarry Shandling, famous comic, would answer all twenty questions \"Yes.\" \\nTeri Arangucn, my accountant, answered only four \"Yes.\" If you answered \\nmore like Garry and less like Teri, then give up the spreadsheet—you have \\na comic\\'s disposition. You might be working as an accountant but you are \\nthinking like a comic. It\\'s not how you currently make your living that \\nmakes you a comic but how you think—how you sec the world, your atti\\xad\\ntude about the absurdity surrounding you, and of course, how you can \\nmake people laugh. If you imitate your family members behind their \\nbacks, you\\'re not being rude; you\\'re doing what we call act-outs. If you are \\nfunny when you get angry, you already know how to deliver with attitude. \\nIf you have opinions about the service in a restaurant, the new TV season, \\ninterest rates, don\\'t think of yourself as a know-it-all; you have a hit on \\n(i topic. And if you are insanely jealous of other comics\\' success, it just \\nmight be a healthy expression of your own desires for success. But if you \\nwant to watch other comics in clubs, follow them home, and watch them \\nthrough binoculars, you\\'re not an observational comic—you\\'re a stalker. \\nGet help. \\nWe funny people are not normal. In my workshops, the normal ones \\nare not the lunny ones. We think differently. For instance, having a hard \\ntime at work? Normal people think, \"What a bad day.\" Comics think, \"A \\nbad \\'lay . . . and material!\" \\n\"I used to work in an office. They\\'re always so mean to the new girl in the office. \\n\\'Oh, Caroline, you\\'re new? You have lunch at nine-thirty.\\' I worked as a \\nreceptionist, but I couldn\\'t get the hang of it. I kept answering the phone by \\nsaying, \\'Hello, can you help me?\\' It\\'s so humiliating to go on job interviews, especially when they ask, \\'What was the reason you left your last job?\\' \\'Well, I \\nfound that after I was hired, there was a lot of tension in the office. You know, I \\nfound it difficult sitting on the new girl\\'s lap.\\'\" \\n—CAROLINE RHEA \\nNormal people express their sense of humor by memorizing \\njokes; comics transform their life experiences into \\npunch lines and write their own jokes. \\nWe funny people are a strange sort. We like \\naughs, even at our own expense. We funny people \\nwere the cave people who probably slipped on the \\nbanana peel just because we were certain that it \\nwould get a laugh. We think a lot about little \\nthings, such as lint or hotel soap. \\n\"I like tiny hotel soap. I pretend that it\\'s normal soap and \\nPP my muscles are huge.\" \\n—JERRY SEINFELD \\nWe think slanted—out of the box. \\n\"A lot of people are afraid of heights. Not me—I\\'m afraid of widths.\" \\n—STEVEN WRI6HT \\nMost people hide their defects; we comics show them to the world \\nMatter of fact, the more people who know about how fat we are, how \\nbald, how insecure, the better we feel—as long as we get a laugh. \\n\"I have low self-esteem. When we were in bed together, I would fantasize that / \\nwas someone else.\" \\n—RICHARD LEWIS \\nWe love to expose stupidity \\n\"Please, if you ever see me getting beaten \\nup by the police, please put your video \\ncamera down and help me.\" \\n—BOBCAT GOLDTHWAIT Bobcat Goldthwart We generally grew up in a family where lew tilings were really dis\\xad\\ncussed and communication was at a minimum, but we remember every \\nhumiliating thing that happened. \\n\"I don\\'t feel good about myself. I recently broke up with this woman. Why? I felt \\nshe wasn\\'t into me. I said, \\'I love you. I adore you. I worship you.\\' And she said, \\n\\'Ain\\'t that a kick in the head.\\'\" \\n—RICHARD LEWIS \\nWe\\'ve kept a mental record of our family\\'s weirdncss because we \\nknew even at an early age that they were a source of material. \\n\"Both my parents got high my entire life. We used to go on family trips together \\nwithout even leaving home. I don\\'t have childhood memories. I have flashbacks. \\nI think that\\'s why I hate to travel, because we never went anywhere. Oh wait, we \\ndid . . . rehab. That was fun.\" \\n—VANESSA HOLLINSSHEAD \\nWe usually think that we are the only sane ones in our families, but \\nusually we are sorely mistaken. We are not normal. We are comics. \\nMost people have misconceptions about what comics are like. Comics \\nare not necessarily funny happy, outgoing, laugh-getting clowns. I have a \\nfriend who had the misplaced idea that she would have a really fun din\\xad\\nner party by inviting a bunch of comics. She anticipated a laugh-a-minute \\nkind o( night. Wrong! It was a Nietzsche sort of night: her cooking was \\nanalyzed, two people felt too depressed to talk, and three others felt too fat \\nto eat. At one point, when the conversation turned to creative ways to \\ncommit suicide, the hostess decided that this would be a good time to go \\nto a movie and asked that we lock up when we left. \\n\"If I ever commit suicide I\\'m going to fling myself off the top of a skyscraper, but \\nbefore I do I\\'m going to fill my pockets with candy and gum. That way when the \\nonlookers walk up they can go, \\'Oh, Snickers, hey!\\'\" \\n—PATTON OSWALT \\nBeing a comic or a comedy writer is not for normal people. It\\'s a \\nway of looking not only at your life but at your dreams. If you are a \\ncomic, you probablv even dream funny. It\\'s a discipline to pay atten\\xad\\ntion to ideas that come at all times, even during sex. \"Hold it right there. honey, I\\'ve got to write this idea down.\" It\\'s about living in the funm \\nzone twenty-four hours every day—watching life, having opinions, \\nrecording them, and fleshing them out to a finished piece. That\\'s the dis\\xad\\ncipline. \\nWe all have funny ideas. We wake up with them; we get them in our sleep, \\nor while drinking coffee or driving our car, and even in times of griel. \\nEllen DeGeneres is an example of someone who managed to turn \\ntragedy into comedy. A close friend of hers had died, and while alone and \\ngrieving in her fleabag apartment, she was inspired to write a routine that \\nwould one day make her a star—\"A Phone Call to God.\" \\n\"I don\\'t understand why we have fleas here because fleas do nothing at all \\nbeneficial. But I thought at times like this when we can\\'t figure it out for \\nourselves. . . wouldn\\'t it be great if we could pick up the phone and call up God \\nand ask him these things. Just pick up the phone and call up God—\\'Yeah, hi God, \\nit\\'s Ellen . . . Listen, God, there\\'s certain things on this earth. I just don\\'t \\nunderstand why they\\'re here. No, not Fabio. No. But there are certain things, I \\nmean, Jesus Christ. No, I didn\\'t mean that. That was great. We\\'re still talking \\nabout that. No, I was thinking more about insects. No, bees are great. The honey. \\nThat was clever. You\\'re welcome. I was thinking more about fleas. . . they seem to \\nhave no beneficial .. . [waiting] No, I didn\\'t realize how many people were \\nemployed by the flea collar industry ... not to mention sprays. Well, I guess \\nyou\\'re right. Of course you are ...\"\" [edited] \\nWhenever I tell someone that I\\'m a comic, they bend my ear about \\ntheir idea for a sitcom, a screenplay, or a joke. \"You know, a lot of people \\ntell me that I\\'m funny!\" the person will say. \\n\"OK, and please install my cable, Mr. Funnyman.\" \\nSo, what is the difference between someone making a living from \\ntheir ideas and someone who sees their ideas on TV and says, \"Hey, I \\nthought of that?\" \\nIt starts with paying attention and writing your ideas down. Many \\nfunny people aren\\'t even aware that the ideas flying through their minds \\nhave the potential to become successful creative ventures. Some people \\nare so overwhelmed with the day-to-day struggles of life that they don\\'t \\neven pay any attention to that quiet insightful voice, the one that says, \"This is really funny, I should write it down,\" and the voice that says, \\n\"This would be a great television episode.\" You might say to yourself that \\nthese ideas are nothing. But look what Jerry Seinfeld did with \"nothing.\" \\nThere are a thousand little observations about the details of life that fly \\npast us every day. Don\\'t let them go to waste. \\nPRO TALK with Carol Leifer, stand-up and writer/producer on Seinfeld \\n\"I get my ideas from life. I was out at dinner and ordered a bottle of \\nwine and the waiter gave me the cork to smell, and 1 felt stupid sitting \\nthere sniffing it. \\'Yeah, that\\'s a cork.\\' And then the waiter laughed, so I \\nW rote it down and put it in my act—\\'You feel like such an idiot, the guy \\nhands you the cork and it\\'s like, \"I don\\'t know what I\\'m supposed to \\ndo . . .\" Like, \"uh, yeah, yep, that\\'s cork.\" \\' \" \\nBuy Comedy Supplies \\n• pen \\n• small notebook (one that fits in a pocket) \\n• large binder \\n• 100 index cards \\n• small tape recorder (digital is the best to save your ideas as individual \\nsound bites) \\nExercise: Keeping an Idea Book \\nYou\\'ve probably been thinking up ideas for many, many years. Well, now \\nIt\\'s time to write them down. Get yourself a notebook that you keep by \\nyour bed and another, smaller one that can fit in your pocket. Carry this, \\na working pen, and a small tape recorder with you all day. You don\\'t want \\nto lose the next major sitcom hit that will boost the profits of NBC \\nbecause that day you didn\\'t have a pen that worked. Write down all ideas \\nWithin a few minutes of thinking about them. \\nDivide the big book into sections—for example, jokes, sitcom, film, \\nand career ideas. Each morning before you get out of bed, before you pee, \\nspend just ten minutes writing down fresh ideas. If you don\\'t have any, \\nthen just keeping writing about anything—your dreams, your revenge fantasies, anything. They don\\'t have to be funny. Just the act of writing \\ndown these ideas will keep the mental pipeline open. \\nThe morning is the best time to write. Keep the paper and a pen by \\nyour bed so that when you wake up, all you need to do is reach over and \\nstart writing. If you need coffee badly, then prepare it the night before \\nand put it in a thermos by your bed. Any activity that you put between \\nyou and writing will give you an excuse not to do it at all. If you have to \\ngo to work early, set your alarm ten minutes earlier. It\\'s a start. \\nDo not get out of bed before concluding this brief writing period. And \\ndo not give in to any self-negotiations, like \"I\\'ll skip today because tomor\\xad\\nrow I\\'ll have the whole day to write.\" This line of thinking is a formula for \\nsabotage. Very few writers write the whole day. It\\'s unrealistic. Can you \\nwrite for ten minutes? It might not seem like much, but if you fill three \\npages a day, in a week you\\'ll end up with twenty-one pages. At the end of \\na year, that\\'s a book, a screenplay, an act. \\nThese morning writings are not supposed to be masterpieces. Occa\\xad\\nsionally you\\'ll produce an incredible idea, wonderful dialogue, hysterical \\njokes, but for the most part it will be drivel, and that\\'s OK. Get the juices \\ngoing, the records in place, and the discipline in gear. The more pages you \\nhave; the more likely you are to hit on some truly inventive stuff. As any\\xad\\none in sales knows, it\\'s a numbers game. The more darts you throw, the \\nmore likely you are to hit something. The more people you dale . . . You \\ngel the idea. It\\'s like Anrway. \\nPRO TALK with comic George Wallace \\n\"I write my joke from seeing slupid things. Stupid signs. \\'Quiet Hospi\\xad\\ntal Zone.\\' And there\\'s nothing making noise but the ambulance—a big \\nsiren going \\'Woooo.\\' \" \\nIf something does strike you as a workable idea, put it on an index \\ncard. These index cards will come in handy when outlining a sitcom or \\nputting together your stand-up act. PRO TALK with comic Richard Lcivis \\n\"I carry a pad of paper everywhere and if some\\xad\\nthing strikes me funny I write the premise down. \\nOver the course of a few months I will have thou\\xad\\nsands of these premises and I circle those that \\nreally make me laugh, and think about how I can \\nactually say it onstage. Over the course of a tour, \\npremises develop and grow into routines and \\noftentimes strong one-liners. I tape every show and \\nif I ad-lib, I add that to the show.\" \\nSome suggestions about this free-form writing: \\nDo not judge it. \\nRe messy. \\nDo not try lo be funny. \\nDon\\'t go back and reread your stuff for at least a month. That way you\\'ll \\nbe able to reread it with fresh eyes. \\nIdeas are starting points and are neither good nor bad. There are half-\\nbaked ideas, crazy, wild, tiny, and big ideas, but none of them should be \\njudged before you take each for a run. One of the mistakes neophyte \\ncomics make is thai they are too quick to label an idea bad, wrong, or stu\\xad\\npid before they investigate it. \\nFor instance, which of these ideas is \"bad\"? \\nIdea for a sitcom—\"How about a sitcom where a nun has a big hat thai \\nmakes her fly?\" \\nIdea for a film—\"It\\'s the middle of the Korean War. Everyone is getting \\nblown to bits. But the doctors are really funny.\" \\nIdea for a joke—\"I\\'m so depressed I want to kill myself. I wonder if there \\nis a punch line here?\" All of those ideas led to comedy that made money: \\n• The Flying Nun was a popular TV series starring a very young Sally Field. \\n• M*A*S*II was a wildly popular film directed by Robert Altman and \\nserved as the basis for a long-running and very successful sitcom. \\n• One of comic Paula Poundstone\\'s signature pieces was about suicide. \\n\"I tried using carbon monoxide, but my building has a big underground parking \\ngarage so it was taking a really long time. I had to bring along a stack of books and \\nsome snacks.

Write ai least one idea in your notebook \\n• for a joke \\n• for a sitcom \\n• for a magazine article \\n• for a film \\nStudying what makes you and others laugh is a great starting point for \\nunderstanding corned}\\'. Sometimes it\\'s someone\\'s attitude, the way they say \\nsomething, the combination of different points of view, an argument, or \\nsimple stupidity. Carry around your idea book with you for the next forty-\\neight hours and write down exactly what you saw, heard, or said that got a \\nlaugh or a smile. Telling a joke does not count, unless it was a joke that you \\nwrote. Rather, your laugh-getting comment could be an off-the-cuff remark \\nyou made while at your therapist\\'s office, at a party, at the office, or at the \\ndinner table. Get off the couch, out of the house, and pay attention! \\nMake a list of what got laughs. Describe what it felt like to get laughs. Be descriptive rather than just say\\xad\\ning, \"It felt good.\" \\nLook over the lists you just made. You might have noticed that when \\nvou are getting laughs, there is something that you are doing differently \\nthat is making you funny. It\\'s important to know what that something is. \\nFor example, if you got a laugh while telling a friend a painful story about \\nsomething that happened to you, did you exaggerate the humiliation? \\nDid you make up things that didn\\'t really happen? Did you make your\\xad\\nself more of a victim? \\nFind five things you or someone else did that heightened the \"funny,\" and write \\nthem here. \\n\"People ask me, \\'Steve, how do you get so funny?\\' I say to \\nthem, \\'Before I go onstage I put a fish in each shoe. That way \\nI feel funny.\\'\" \\n—STEVE MARTIN \\nLook over your list about the feelings you get \\nfrom making other people laugh. Are the following \\nsome ol these words on your list—alive, present, \\nplayful, angry, imaginative, energized? If so, then you \\nKnow what it\\'s like to be in the funny zone. All of us funny people have been there. You\\'re at a party and the subject \\nof bad dates comes up. You join in with stories about your own dating hell. \\nbut you\\'re in the funny zone and you\\'re getting laughs. Matter of fact, the \\nmore horrible the story is, the more everyone laughs. You ride it, and you \\nget a feel for controlling the laughs, exaggerating just the right amount, act\\xad\\ning out your dale, adding the perfect amount of sarcasm—you are in the \\nzone. And that is how you create comedy material. It was spon\\xad\\ntaneous and it worked. The trick is to write it down \\nas soon as you can, before you forget what you said. \\nKeep track because life is full of comedy material. \\n\"I hate singles\\' bars. Guys come up to me and say, \\'Hey, \\ncupcake, can I buy you a drink?\\' I say, \\'No, but I\\'ll take the \\nthree bucks.\\'\" \\n—MARGARET SMITH \\nHave you ever had a fight with someone that \\nturned funny? There you are, both yelling at each \\nother when suddenly you take a turn into the funny-\\nzone—still angry, but funny. You might be still fight\\xad\\ning, but you are also creating great comedy dialogue. Write \\nit down. And you\\'ll probably win the fight, too. We are more likely \\nto win fights with a punch line than a punch-out. \\n\"Does it hurt your back to kiss your own ass like that?\" \\n—FROM NBC\\'s WILL AND Gum, WILL\\'S RETORT TO A FRIEND \\nWHO is BRAGGING ABOUT WHAT A LADIES\\' MAN HE IS \\nLooking in the mirror you notice that you\\'ve gained weight, but \\ninstead of calling yourself a worthless tub of lard you start playing with \\nyour bulging midriff and start seeing some advantages to being fat. You \\nhave leaped into the zone. And you write it down. \\n\"I used to think it was weird that dogs had nipples on their stomach. . . then I \\nlooked at myself naked.\" \\n—JUDY CARTER \\nMy experience as a comedy coach has been that when students bring in \\nmaterial that they carefully plotted out on their computers, it can be lever and smart but sound too literary and contrived to get laughs. The \\nbest way to write killer material, the kind that will rock a room and \\nthreaten to create hernias from laughing too hard, is to capture and \\ngepand upon spontaneous moments. That means that you want to create \\nmaterial when you are in the funny zone. \\nAs children we play and joke and aren\\'t worried about what ethers \\nthink. Put a comic and a kid onstage and the audience invariably will \\nwatch the child, because children are always in the zone. You can write \\ncomedy while sitting alone at a computer, but it might end up sounding \\ntoned and devoid of energy. This doesn\\'t mean you necessarily need to be \\nstanding, talking, writing, and improvising all at the same time when you \\ncreate comedy material. It\\'s different for everyone. You need to tind for \\nyourself what it takes to put you in the zone. \\nFor me, it\\'s working in front of another comic—someone who doesn\\'t \\njud<»e me and understands that 80 percent of my attempts at comedy \\nmaterial are going to fail. Someone who keeps the energy going. I almost \\nnever create material alone or sitting down. I need to be standing up. I am \\nnot funny in a chair. I also .never fully write my material down. Instead, I \\njot notes on the back of unopened junk mail envelopes. That is what \\nworks for me. What works for you may be very different. \\nExercise: Finding Your F-Zone \\nLook back at the exercise \"Writing Your Ideas\" on page 40, where you \\nlisted what you were saying when you made others laugh. Describe the \\ncircumstances. Were you standing? Was there music on? What else? \\nRecreating these circumstances will help to put you in the f-/.onc no mat\\xad\\nter what kind of mood vou are in. \\nBut getting into the zone is just a start. Whether it\\'s a joke, a script, \\nor a greeting card, comedy takes work. I\\'ve seen a lot of very lunny, tal\\xad\\nented people quit when the going got tough. Comedy can get scary. PRO TALK Martha Graham to Agnes De Milk \\n\"There is a vitality, a lire force, an energy, a quickening that is trans\\xad\\nlated through you into action. And because there is only one of you in \\nall of time, this expression is unique, and if you block it, it will never \\nexist through any other medium, and be lost. It is not your business to \\ndetermine how good it is, nor how valuable, nor how it compares with \\nother expressions. You do not even have to believe in yourself or your \\nwork. It is your business to keep the channel open.\" \\nDoes the thought of standing alone onstage trying to make a sea of \\nstrangers laugh scare you? Do you get a knot in your stomach at the \\nwords \"Well, I read your script and I have some comments\"? Does sitting \\nin front of a computer with no ideas whatsoever fill you with thoughts of \\n\"Well, maybe working at Staples wasn\\'t that bad!\" \\nIf comedy scares you, then congratulations—you get it. Comedy is \\nscary A survey taken by USA Today noted that the number one fear peo\\xad\\nple share is not the fear of dying but the fear of standing in front of peo\\xad\\nple—and dying, so to speak. Just look at the words comics use: \"I died.\" \\n\"I killed them.\" \"I slayed them.\" Comedy can be violent. Or at least it can feel that way. So. if you aren\\'t frightened of doing comedy or writing \\ncomedy, take your pulse—you might be dead. \\nYou also might have some \"neggie\" voices turning up the volume \\n« hen you try to do something creative. Do any of the following criticisms \\nhave a familiar ring to them? \\n\"You\\'re no good.\" \\n\"You\\'re stupid.\" \\n\"You\\'re doing it wrong.\" \\nSome of us have had our creativity so beaten down by others—most \\nlikelv parents—that we annihilate our own ideas before they can take \\nform- Let\\'s say that when you were a child you built the most wondrous \\nsand castle. You were absolutely committed to translating the vision in \\nyour head into reality. Then let\\'s say your dad comes along and tells you \\nthat you are doing it wrong. \"Castles don\\'t look like that,\" he says. \"Do \\nit this way.\" How do you think you are going to feel the next time you \\nare in the sand? You don\\'t want to do it wrong, so you just don\\'t do it. \\nHow mans- times did something like that happen to you? Take those \\nexperiences and multiply them limes a million and you might under\\xad\\nstand what\\'s blocking your creative free expression of your ideas. It \\nbecomes safer not doing, not trying, not taking the risk of being wrong. \\nYou become another person, sitting on a couch drinking beer and criti\\xad\\ncizing others, saying things like, \"This guy sucks. I could do it better \\nthan him.\" \\nBut you don\\'t do it at all. \\nIt\\'s worth spending some time on the topic of fear. I see so many very tal\\xad\\nented comedy neophytes quit because they let fear get the best of them. \\nOne student in my class was so terrified of going onstage that he made his \\nbeeper go off as if he were being paged. Each time, he said, \"My wife is \\nhaving a baby.\" By the third class, we knew something was up, or that his \\nwife was having triplets and it was a very long labor. Many students won\\'t \\nadmit that they are frightened. They just stop showing up. \\nI ear is not the problem. The problem lies in the way we deal with it— \\n°r rather don\\'t deal with it. A lot of times we don\\'t realize when we are \\nfrightened, even though our actions and decisions are based solely on \\nfear. For instance, we might not go to a party because we are frightened to go alone, but what we tell ourselves is, \"I\\'m too tired, I have a big day \\ntomorrow.\" \\nYour unexpressed fears could be holding your creative process \\nhostage. You might stop reading this book because you feel uncomfort\\xad\\nable about failing, but what you say to yourself is, \"It isn\\'t practical for \\nme to do comedy,\" or, \"I\\'m wasting my time,\" or, \"I\\'m the leader of the \\nfree world; I should be focusing on Iraq.\" And slowly but surely the \"prac\\xad\\nticality\" that cloaks our fears pounds our dreams into dust. \\nBrave people are not unafraid. What distinguishes them is that they act \\ndespite the fear. And funny people don\\'t necessarily find it easy to pop off \\nbelore an audience of two thousand. Actually, people who are self-confident \\nand even saintly aren\\'t the funniest people in the world. You might notice \\nthat there are not many spiritual gurus who have achieved cosmic con\\xad\\nsciousness hanging around open-mike nights at comedy clubs. Also, inse\\xad\\ncurity is funny. Woody Allen is at his funniest when he\\'s most neurotic. \\n\"I don\\'t mind death—I just don\\'t want to be there when it happens.\" \\n—WOODY ALLEN \\nSo if you\\'re waiting to get more confidence before you perform— \\nforget it. Do the following instead. \\nExercise: Judy\\'s 5-Step Fear Management Program \\nStep 1. Admit Your Fears to Yourself \\nStand-up Comedy Fears \\nImagine yourself doing stand-up. Write all thoughts of fear, impend\\xad\\ning doom, anxiety, apprehension, dread, foreboding, or panic in the right \\ncolumn. And be honest, not funny. \\nJudy\\'s Fear List \\nBombing \\nI laving hack material \\nLooking fat \\nIncontinence \\nRunning out of material \\nThe audience doesn\\'t get me. \\nI make a fool of myself. \\nI have to follow someone who reallv kills. \\nThey\\'ll hate me. Your Fear List ScriptivritingFears. Imagine you\\'re writing a script. What are your fears? \\nStep 2. Evaluate Your Fears \\nNow go back over these lists and cross off all unrealistic fears. For \\ninstance, if one of your fears is dying onstage, you can X that out. More \\npeople have died from clogged pores than from doing stand-up. Although \\nperforming might make you sweat and grunt, dying is not an option even \\nwhen you wish it would be. \\nStep 3. Confide in a Friend \\nThen call a friend and tell him or her your realistic fears. Fear loses \\na lot of its power when it\\'s out in the open. Plus you might also get a \\nfew laughs. Some of the best material comes from outbursts of honesty. \\nWith the right twist, those neggie thoughts of yours can turn into com\\xad\\nedy gold. \\n\"This guy told me he thought I was attractive. When I get a nice compliment I like \\nto take it in, swish it around in my brain . . . until it becomes an insult.\" \\n—SHEILA WENZ \\nStep 4. Golden Opps \\nIn this exercise we are going to play out our realistic fears and, step by \\nStep, give them a positive spin. For instance, one of my fears is, \"Nobody \\n\"ill understand me.\" Write one of your fears here: Your fear is ludy\\'s Fear List \\n1 won\\'t have ideas. \\nI\\'m wasting time. \\nfll be bored. \\nIt\\'s lonely. \\nfll discover that 1 have no talent. \\nSomeone will steal my idea. \\n1 won\\'t be able to sell it. \\nMv script sucks. \\nMv characters suck. Your Fear List On the left column I play out each step of what will happen with my \\nfear, playing it out until it turns positive. You fill in the right column. \\nWrite as many or as few as you can think of. \\nJudy\\'s List \\nIf nobodv understands me . . . \\nthen I\\'ll feel misunderstood \\nthen I\\'ll feel bad \\nthen it will get back to my agent \\nthen I will lose my agent \\nthen I\\'ll get a better agent \\nthen I\\'ll have better gigs \\nthen I \\'11 have a better career \\nthen I\\'ll be performing at places \\nwhere everyone understands me Your List \\nIf . . . \\nthen . . \\nthen . . \\nthen . . \\nthen . . \\nthen . . \\nthen . . \\nthen . . \\nthen . . \\nthen . . . \\nStep 5. Take Action \\nFear is like the school bully who\\'s made you his target. You can try to \\navoid him by walking home a different way, but he will always find you. \\nAre you going to let the fear of losing your lunch money dictate where \\nand how you live? Or will you do the scary thing and deal directly with \\nthe bad guy? Successful people arc not necessarily less frightened than \\nyou—they just do things in spite of being frightened. \\nPRO TALK with Phyllis Diller \\n\"For fifteen years I was terror-\\nstricken. Try flop sweat that ended \\nup in your shoes! 1 never had to soak \\nmy feet, they got soaked every night. \\nIn fact, I am still wearing the same very \\nexpensive Herbert Levine boots and the \\ninside leather lining has been eaten by the acid of my \\nflop sweat, fust because you are frightened doesn\\'t mean that you are \\nnever going to make it. In my case, I had to do it—I had five hungry \\nchildren. Poverty and motherhood together are the greatest motivation \\nin this world.\" Phyllis Diller Most human beings are afraid to look stupid, and when doing com-\\nedv. we take that risk in a big way. There is only one way to deal with this \\nfear—do something stupid. \\nPick something that you are scared of doing and go do it—something \\nlegal, of course. It won\\'t help to say something like, \"Oh, Officer, I robbed \\nthe bank because I\\'m working on my comedy career.\" \\nPick something to do that is out of your comfort zone. It doesn\\'t even \\nhave to be about comedy It can be: \\na \"I\\'m going to call and ask someone out.\" \\na \"I\\'m going to ask for a raise.\" \\na \"I\\'m going to eat lunch with a stranger.\" \\n• \"I\\'m going to tell my parents I\\'m gay.\" (Even if you\\'re not.) \\nOr it can be something to further your comedy career: \\na \"I\\'m going to perform at an open mike.\" \\n• \"I\\'m going to call an agent.\" \\n• \"I\\'m going to write new material.\" \\nExercise: Taking Action \\nWrite down five actions that you would like to do today were you not \\nblocked by fear. \\nNow pick one and do it! \\nAfter you take action on one of your fears, write how it felt. Was it as \\nseary as you thought? Can you do something tomorrow that is even \\nscarier? I strongly recommend working through this book with a comedy buddy. \\nJay Leno, Dennis Miller, and Rosie O\\'Donnell don\\'t develop material \\nalone and neither should you. Most often sitcom writers are hired in \\nteams. It\\'s important to have someone to bounce your ideas off. 1 can \\nalways identify the students in my workshops who work alone; after they \\ndeliver their jokes, the class stares blankly at them, going, \"Huh?\" Run\\xad\\nning material by a comedy buddy before going public assists comics in \\neliminating all the this-is-relatable-only-to-myself-and-my-cat jokes. So, \\nuntil you have your own staff, find at least one buddy you feel comfort\\xad\\nable with, someone you can get stupid with and can bomb in front of— \\nbecause sometimes comedy is not pretty. \\nYou have to be careiul about who you choose. Some people make von \\nFed funnier just by being around them. Others make you wonder if \\nyou\\'ve ever been funny in your life. Your grandmother might make you \\nnice cookies but she may not get your sense of humor. \\nA good comedy session is like a hot game of tennis. You want to play \\nwith someone who is going to return your ideas and maybe even put a \\nnew spin on them. If you keep serving and your comedy buddy never \\nreturns the ball, think about working with someone else. \\nPRO TALK with comic George Wallace \\n\"I started stand-up in New York with Seinfeld and we always bounced \\nmaterial off each other. When we had a bit that wasn\\'t working, other \\nNew York comics would say, \\'Try this and try that.\\' In New York, comics \\ntend to hang out together and network and get other jobs, where in L.A., \\nthey have cars and they\\'ve got to get back to their respective counties.\" \\nExercise: Finding the Right Comedy Buddy \\nMake a list of five friends who you would feel comfortable working with. \\n1. __ \\n2. j-\\n4. \\n5. \\nCan\\'t think of anyone?

After ten years of \\nteaching, I\\'ve learned that it\\'s not always the person with the most talent \\nwho succeeds—it\\'s the one with the most endurance. \\n\"Hey, Judy, I haven\\'t even begun. Why bring up quitting now?\" \\nPlanning when you quit is better than quitting in reaction to a bad \\naudience, a writer\\'s block, or a lack of progress. How many projects have \\nyou started and never finished? Probably quite a few. Sometimes we quit \\nbecause we get bored, or because we don\\'t have time, or the going gets \\nrough, or we start having a hot affair and are doing our best just to get out \\nof bed. Most likely you won\\'t make a conscious decision when to quit \\nworking on comedy; rather, your enthusiasm will just fade away. \\nQuitting is not necessarily a bad thing, \\\\fyou control it. jerry Seinfeld \\nquit alter nine years of a highly successful TV series, Seinfeld, even though \\nNBC offered him S5 million an episode. Seinfeld listened to his inner \\ncomic. \"I felt the moment,\" he said about his decision to retire the show \\nin 1998. \"I knew from being onstage for years and years and years, there\\'s \\none moment where you have to feel the audience is still having a great \\ntime, and if you get off right there, they walk out of the theater excited. \\nAnd yet, if you wait a little bit longer and try to give them more for their \\nmoney, t hey walk out feeling not as good. If I get off now, 1 have a chance \\nat a standing ovation.\" \\nActually there is another reason Seinfeld stopped short of a tenth \\nseason: nine is his lucky number. \"He\\'s very superstitious,\" his mother, \\nHetty, told magazine writer Debra L. Wallace. \"Everything has to be divis\\xad\\nible by nine.\" \" PRO TALK with comic Richard Lewis \\n\"I didn\\'t make money at doing stand-up for a long time, but I never \\nthough 1 about quitting. I did it purely for the passion of it all.\" \\nBeing successful in comedy means making a commitment to your cre\\xad\\native process. That means deciding at the starting gate where your finish \\nline is and committing to run the entire race. \\nPRO TALK with Jim Carrey \\n\"Before Ace [Ventura, Pet Detective] came out, I spent fifteen years on the \\ncoined}\\' club circuit. I once had a repertoire of a hundred and fifty \\nimpressions, and promises of fame and promises of glory that faded \\naway.

Forsake them and you could spend your entire career in \\nopen-mike purgatory or spec script hell. \\nI. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor\\'s jokes, premises, or bits. \\nThroughout this book there are examples of jokes from my students and \\nthe pros. This material is for educational purposes only. It is copyrighted \\nmaterial and should not be reproduced or stolen. When you rip off some\\xad\\nbody else\\'s material, you are not only robbing them; you\\'re also stealing \\nfrom yourself because you\\'re not pursuing your own creative process. You \\nmight think of another comic\\'s material while reading this book, but \\ndon\\'t delude yourself by pretending that you thought of it. You\\'ll cheat \\nyourself from developing your own unique perspective. Don\\'t swim in \\nthose waters. \\nSomeone else\\'s material might help to get your foot in the door, but \\nyou\\'ll soon find some comic\\'s foot in your butt. Word will get around fast \\nthat you steal material, and since a lot of comics book clubs, you will get \\nblacklisted and never again work. Your own material—don\\'t do coated) \\nwithout it. 2. Honor thy mother and father, but don\\'t hesitate to put them in your \\nact or scripts. \\nSome beginning comics think it\\'s disrespectful to poke fun at their par-\\n- us rhey\\'re right. But being a comic is not about being nice and polite— \\nit\\'s about being funny. Those little irritating habits of your parents can be \\ncomedy gold- Actually, students are surprised to find that their parents \\nc flattered to be included in their act. But no guarantees here about \\nstaving in the will. \\n3. Thou shalt not bear false witness. \\nBe authentic with your point of view and explore topics that you really \\ncare about. The old days of doing disingenuous jokes for the sake of being \\nfunnv will sound hack. Humiliating your wife or husband for the sake of \\na laugh won\\'t make you famous and might make you single. Can you say \\n\"divorce\"? \\n4. Thou shalt notice how stupid God made the world. \\nFunny is all around you. Keep your eyes open. Write down all the wcird-\\nness, stupidity, and oddness you see. \\n5. Thou shalt get a comedy buddy. \\nMaterial that you write by yourself is guaranteed to makejww laugh—and \\nusually, that\\'s about it. If you want to make sure it will make someone else \\nlaugh, why not have someone with you while you write it? Working with \\nsomeone can help you find new slants on the old stuff and keep cranking \\nil out when you want to nap. \\n6- Thou shalt choose a comedy writing day and keep it holy. \\nMake the time to get together with your comedy buddy as important as \\nyour appointment with your therapist, lover, or plastic surgeon. Don\\'t \\nteak your dates with your comedy buddy. \\n\\'• Thou shalt carry around a pad and a pen at all times. \\necaiise you never know when \"funny\" will happen, earn\\' a small note-\\n10,,k in your pocket, bag, or backpack. When weirdness happens, write it down. You may think that you will remember it. but chances are you \\nwon\\'t. \\n8. Thou shalt not skip any of the exercises in Part One. \\nThey may seem silly or pointless, but those exercises will help you form a \\nstockpile of raw material that you will later turn into killer stuff. Don\\'t \\nwaste time getting critical of your ideas. Even the flimsiest of ideas can \\nlead to something extraordinary \\n9. Create a stand-up act even if you just want to write sitcoms. \\nIn the kernel of a joke lives the underlying structure of all comedy forms. \\nIf you know how to write a joke, you will be able to translate that skill \\ninto writing scripts, articles, and other comedy forms. \\nIf you\\'re wondering where the tenth commandment is, then con\\xad\\ngratulations. You\\'re already starting to notice the weird, the stupid, and \\nthe odd. \\nExercise: Your Creative Process \\nWhere are you the most creative? In the living room, bed, or maybe on \\nthe toilet? To get the creative juices flowing, do you need quiet, your \\nstereo blasting, or just more fiber in your diet? \\nWhat is the best environment for your creative process?

(I do it in the morning or I \\ndon\\'t do it at all.) \\nWho is your best choice for a comedy buddy? (Relatives are generally not a \\ngood choice.) Action Checklist \\nSo far I\\'ve \\npassed the funny test \\ngot my comedy supplies—pen, small notebook, large binder, index cards \\nwritten down ideas for a joke, a sitcom, a magazine article, and a film \\nexamined what makes me laugh and what puts me in the funny zone \\ncompleted Judy\\'s 5-Step Fear Management Program \\nsigned and mailed in the commitment contract That\\'s right, twenty-six days from now you are going to know how to \\nwrite jokes based on your life experiences and perform them. Many \\nof my students who have followed these techniques have ended up as \\nworking stand-up comics and comedy writers. Why not you? \\nNote. The instructions in this book are suggestions only. Joke writing \\nis a very elusive art form and there are many different ways of approach\\xad\\ning it. There might be some exercises that will do nothing for you and \\nsome comedy theories that you will find stupid and of no help. That\\'s \\ngood. You\\'re funny—you\\'re supposed to find things stupid. I always say, \\nuse what works for you and leave the rest. And if nothing works for you, \\nwell, sorry, no refund. \\nBut Judy, I\\'m really a writer. I have no Intention of performing. TIte \\nidea of getting up onstage makes me want to projectile-vomit.\" \\nPRO TALK with Rob Lotterstein, sitcom writer, TV producer, former stand-up \\nstudent \\nMy goal wasn\\'t to be a stand-up comic, as anyone who saw me per-\\nform could tell you. But doing stand-up taught me how to pitch jokes \\nand story ideas which get me work. And from working in front of an \\naudience I got a real feel of what makes people laugh.\" Even if it\\'s scary and you have no intention of being a Stand-up \\ncomic, you\\'ll get a lot out of giving performing a try. Stand-up comics are \\nvery often hired to write sitcoms, political sound bites, books, and screen\\xad\\nplays, as well as to direct and write movies. Why? Because stand-up is the \\nmost condensed frm of comedy, and if you understand the basic principles of \\nthe simplest of jokes, you will be able to translate that skill to many dif-\\nierent domains, whether writing, performing, or marketing. Because it\\'s \\nall about making an audience laugh. And whelher that audience is sitting \\nat a nightclub, watching your sitcom on TV, or reading your script, you \\nhave to make them laugh. \\nAll comedy forms have basically the same structure. A joke is just the \\nsparest version of that form. As elegant as a haiku, a joke has a setup, a \\nturn, and a tag. A sitcom has act one, a turn, and a resolve. A screenplay \\nhas the same elements—it\\'s just a longer form. And look at a greeting card: \\nthe front cover is the setup; open it and there\\'s the punch. Many comedy \\nprofessionals started out by doing stand-up. Thus it\\'s not too surprising \\nthat major motion picture comedy director Tom Shadyac (who directed \\nLiar Liar, Ace Ventura, Vie Nutty Professor, and Patch Adams) started in stand-\\nup—in my class! TV comedy writers Rob Lotterstein (Dream On, Caroline \\nin the City) and Davey DiGeorgio (Late Slum7 with David Lctterman) jump-\\nstarted their careers by doing stand-up in my workshop. Comedy actors \\nPaul Reiser, Roseanne Barr, and Michael Keaton all started by performing \\nstand-up—but not in my class. \\nPRO TALK with Tom Shadvac, feature director \\n\"Having started as a stand-up comic, I can truly understand the con\\xad\\ncerns of the actors I work with, such as Jim Carrey Robin Williams, \\nand Eddie Murphy. It really helps.\" \\nSometimes a joke becomes the premise for a sitcom. It then gets \\nmade into a movie, becomes a cartoon strip, and before you can zip open \\nthe lock top, becomes licensed merchandise. \\nSeth MacFarlane, creator and executive producer of the animated \\nshow Family Guy, did stand-up when he was in college. When one of my \\nstudents, Davey DiGeorgio, was interviewed for a staff writing position \\non the Late Show with David Lctterman, his written material was not \\nenough; they wanted to see the video of his stand-up showcase. And if you look at the staff of the top TV sitcoms, most of the writers and pro\\xad\\nducers started by doing stand-up. \\nPRO TALK with Seth MacFarlane, creator and executive producer of\\'Family Guy \\n\"I developed many of the voices for the characters in Family Guy in my \\nStand-up act.\" \\nBut it\\'s not just important to know how to write jokes; it\\'s vital to get \\nup and perform jokes. Since most jokes end up being spoken rather than \\nread, it is necessary for comedy writers to get the direct experience of per\\xad\\nforming their material. Performing stand-up in front of an audience will \\ngive you a direct, immediate feel of what is funny that you can\\'t get from \\nsitting in front of your computer. And although the joke examples in this \\nsection are mostly from stand-up comics, later you will learn how these \\njoke writing principles apply to all forms of comedy—sitcoms, articles, \\nessays, and so on. \\n\"There are a lot of ways to make people laugh. Why is it so important \\nto start as a joke writer?\" \\nHere\\'s one important reason: an invention that has changed the \\nhuman mind forever—the remote control. When you have that little \\nbaby in your hand, you are God, controller of what you see and hear. And \\nhow long does it take before you get bored and change the channel? Two \\nseconds, if you\\'re patient. That means your material has to dazzle an \\naudience in a very short period of time. And in the comedy business, an \\naudience can be anyone—a drunk watching your act, a producer reading \\nyour script, a studio executive listening to a story pitch. Once vou know \\nthe construction of a joke you will know the principles of grabbing and \\nholding the attention of any audience you may have to face. \\nout I don\\'t have time to work on this every day. Should I wait until \\n1 have more time?\" \\nStudents who wait until they have enough time usually wait them\\xad\\nselves out of doing it altogether. Note that these twenty-six days do not need \\n\" \\'\\' consecutive days. The creative process doesn\\'t necessarily happen on a rigid time schedule. When I skip a lew days of writing—OK. a week—it \\nmight appear as if I am a slacker, especially when I\\'m on my snowboard. \\nBut I find that I need that time to process ideas in my subconscious \\nmind. I need to dream my ideas, and then, when I get back to the actual \\nwriting, it flows. Thinking about writing fa working. However, if you are \\ntaking more than four days off, you are a slacker and need to do some\\xad\\nthing to get yourself back on course. If you find yourself really stuck, go \\nback and redo Judy\\'s 5-Step Fear Management Program (page 46) to \\nrejuvenate your creative process. \\nLet\\'s begin . . . \\nTime allotment: one hour to one month, depending on how much you pro\\xad\\ncrastinate. Book yourself doing three minutes at two different open \\nmikes. \\n\"Oh no! I don\\'t even have an act yet! I\\'m going to skip this one.\" \\nComedy is not for wimps. To paraphrase the old saying, \"To procras\\xad\\ntinate is human, to perform is nuts.\" Or something like that. If you art-\\nlike most human beings, you are one big procrastinator. That is why all \\nour comedy workshops, even the ones for novices, end with a showcase. \\nKnowing that they will have to perform in public makes the students \\nreally do the work—now. And committing to two open mikes is impor\\xad\\ntant, because writing comedy is about reworking material. \\nYes, it\\'s scary, but booking yourself before you have an act is a great \\nway to make sure you develop an act;—in this case your fear works for \\nyou. Face it, no matter what you do, you are going to die anyway, so you \\nmight as well take a leap of faith and get yourself some gigs. \\n\"What is an open mike?\" \\nAn open mike is a place where amateurs are permitted to perform— \\ntypically for free. Comedy clubs will often set aside one night for amateurs, \\nand many bookstores, bars, and colleges have open mikes where people \\ncan sign up and perform without having to audition. Sometimes in L.A. \\nand New York you will find pros working out the kinks in their new male-\\nrial, but mostly it\\'s for people who are just beginning their comedy careers. \"flow do I find a place to perform? \\n• Call your local comedy club and find out when they have an amateur night. \\n• Check your local paper for open mikes in coffeehouses, bookstores, bars, \\norganizations, and so on. It you live in one of tne major cities it\\'s often \\nbest to stay clear of the major comedy clubs for the first year and do open \\nmikes in low-profile places. \\n• See if there is an open mike at your college. \\n• Go to our Web site (ivmv.eomedyworkshopS.com) to find out if there arc any \\nopen mikes in your area, and post a query in our comedy forum, \\n• Hang out at a comedy club and ask other comics to suggest places where \\nvou can perform, \\n• If all else fails, start your own open mike. When I was a kid magician, I \\nproduced a show in my backyard for charity. I printed up tickets, went \\ndoor to door inviting people to my show. I actually got it featured in the \\nL.A. limes. Not bad PR for a ten-year-old. \\n\"Are some open mikes better than others? What should I watch out for?\" \\nAll open mikes aren\\'t created equal. Some are not set up for comedy, \\nso no matter how funny you are, you won\\'t get laughs. Here\\'s what to \\nlook for when choosing a venue in which to perform. \\n• Can the audience see the stage? A lot of open mikes are not really set up \\nwell for comedy and have all sorts of obstacles blocking the audience\\'s view. \\nWhen I was starting out, I performed in a revolving bar at a Holiday Inn. \\nBy the time I got to the punch, I had a different audience. Not a good room. \\n• Is it a rowdy room? Sometimes you discover too late that a place is too \\nrough—like when you\\'re already in the ER having bullet fragments \\namoved from your kidneys. So here are a few tips: A sports bar during \\nthe World Series makes a lousy open mike. And if you see a sign that \\nsays, \"All the beer you can drink and comedy too!\" don\\'t expect the \\ncrowd to laugh at Nietzsche jokes. \\n• Is your act right for the room? It might be hard to get a Harlem audience \\nat a Def Jam comedy night to empathize with how hard it was for you to \\npay off your student loans for Harvard, just as your routine about how \\nhard it is to get laid might not get laughs at an open-mike night at the \\nSaint Maria Goretti Catholic Church. \\n• Is there a sound system setup? This is very important—especially if there \\n- hecklers. At least with a mike you will be louder than them. Informal open mikes at coffeehouses or bookstores rarely have mikes, but that\\'s \\nOK because they rarely have alcohol. And sober people tend not to toss \\nout such witty retorts as \"You suck!\" \\nSo, save money on therapy and check out a venue before you commit to \\nperforming there. \\nPRO TALK with comic Diane Nichols \\n\"I was performing at the student union at UCLA and next door was a \\nbowling alley. Every time I got to a punch line somebody would bowl a \\nstrike!\" \\nExercise: Committing to Performing \\nTo successfully do the stand-up course, you will need to book one open \\nmike twenty-one days from today and a second one two weeks later. \\nBecause you are working alone, it might be hard to take this course seri\\xad\\nously. In our workshops, when students don\\'t show up, we page them. To \\nget a bit more real, make a commitment and sign your pledge below—in ink. \\nFirst gig \\nI commit to perform at (name of place) \\non (date) \\nSecond gig: (14 days from above date) \\nI commit to perform at (name of place) \\non (date) \\nBooking Comedy Buddy Sessions \\nIn this twenty-six-day program to get your act together, you will need to \\ncommit to ten meetings with your comedy buddy at certain points in the \\nprocess.

Pay t Action Checklist \\n• I booked two open mikes. \\n• I arranged comedy buddy meetings. \\nDO NOT GO ON TO DAY 2 UNTIL THE ABOVE IS COMPLETED, \\nEVEN IF IT TAKES YOU TWO MONTHS. \\nNote. Read all joke examples out loud so you know what they sound like, \\nrather than what they read like. \\nToday you are going to \\n1. learn comedy structure \\n2. write setups \\n3- get serious about comedy \\nThe structure of stand-up is very simple. Jokes are broken down into \\nfive parts. The setup is not the funny part of a joke, but ii is the most important \\npan. If you can\\'t get the audience interested at the beginning of a joke, \\nthey are not going to be there at the end of the joke. Audiences make up \\ntheir minds very quickly, so on every joke it\\'s important to first capture \\ntheir attention, then make them laugh. \\nSetups are usually very serious and authentic—meaning that thev \\nhave a ring of truth and honesty. Look at these serious setups from some \\nvery funny people. \\n[Setup] \"I hope you\\'re in love and I hope you feel good about yourself, because I \\nam not in love and I don\\'t feel good about myself. I recently broke up with this \\nwoman.\" \\n—RICHARD LEWIS \\n[Setup] \"My doctor told me that I had cancer and I was going to have a hysterectomy.\" \\n—JULIA SWEENEY \\nWhen you seem sincere and personally revealing in your setup, it gets \\nthe audience to relate to what you\\'re talking about. Then, when you \\njump to the funny part, it creates a surprise that makes people laugh. If \\nyou start funny, there is no way to build to the laugh. \\n[Setup] \"My doctor told me that I had cancer and I was going to have a hysterec\\xad\\ntomy, [funny part] Why do they always have to remove a part of your body you \\nneed? Why can\\'t people get cancer of fat? \\'Julia, you\\'ve got cancer of your fat and \\nwe are going to have to take it all out.\\'\" \\n—JULIA SWEENEY \\nI challenge you to be as serious and unfunny as possible when doing \\ntoday\\'s setup exercises. \\n\"/ don\\'t want to be bogged down with structure. I just want to get up \\nthere and be funny.\" \\nPRO TALK with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhist spiritual \\nleader and Nobel Peaee Prize recipient \\n\"Learn the rules so you know how to break them properly.\" Before you break the rules, you need to know what thev are. Trying to \\nhe funny without first knowing the structure will be a hit-and-miss experi-\\neince. Stand-up is a highly structured craft. When done well, it looks like \\nthe comic is just improvising off the top of her head. But really, all profes\\xad\\nsional comics have a thorough understanding of what makes material work \\nor not work. Don\\'t kid yourself. Funny stuff takes work. If it was as easy as \\nthe Pros make it look, many more people would be quitting their day jobs. \\nPRO TAIK with comic CregProops \\n\"No one is a natural—you have to work at being a natural.\" \\nComedy Structure: The Topic \\nAttitude + TOPIC + Premise + Act-out + Mix + Act-out \\nEach joke is always about something, and that something I call a \\ntopic. Unless (he audience is clear about what you are joking about. \\nthey\\'re not going to laugh. Later we will go into great detail about how to \\npick your topics, but for the sake of this exercise, I\\'m going to assign you \\na topic and we will work on the process of developing a joke together. My \\ntopic is \"body piercing.\" Your topic is \"drugs.\" \\n\"But I don\\'t want to joke about drugs.\" \\nShut up. \\nComedy Structure: The Attitude \\nATTITUDE + Topic + Premise + Act-out + Mix + Act-out \\nOur next step is to add attitude to the topic. Attitude gives a joke \\nenergy and direction. Just as actors never say their lines without emotion \\nand intent, neither does a stand-up comic say a joke without attitude. \\nEven when writing comedy, each joke needs to be connected to an attitude \\nOr an emotion. That\\'s why comedy writers often work with a partner or a \\ntape recorder, reciting jokes out loud with attitude, and then write them \\noown. Jokes without altitude can end up sounding too literary, perhaps \\nhumorous but not funny enough to get the big laughs. I lere are the four basic attitudes that are useful for working with this \\nbook—and writing jokes for, say, the rest of your career: \\n1. \"weird\" \\n2. \"scary\" \\n3. \"hard\" \\n4. \"stupid\" \\nMemorize these words. Say them out loud right now. Elongate them \\nas you say them. \"Ilarmrnrd!\" These words are a comic\\'s tool to get the \\nreally big laughs. You might have a tunny idea for a joke, a great topic, a \\nfunny character, but without attitude it will remain just that—a funny \\nidea. You gotta season your raw material by marinating it in attitude. \\nAdding attitude to a joke is like putting gas in your car—now it can go \\nsomeplace. Attitude provides the energy that moves a topic from \\nidea to joke. I cannot emphasize this \\nenough. \\nPiercing is weird. I come from San Fran\\xad\\ncisco, where there are a lot of people into \\nbody piercing. They get to where they look \\nlike they\\'ve been mugged by a staple gun. Fif\\xad\\nteen earrings here, a little towel rack there.\" \\n—ROBIN WILLIAMS \\n\\'The attitude \"weird\" drives Williams\\'s joke \\nand in the end he tells us just how weird piercing is. \\nSometimes the attitude is said in the form of a question. \\n\"Isn\\'t dating hard?\\\\ asked this one girl out and she said, \\'You got a friend?\\' I said \\nyes and she said, \\'Then go out with him.\\'\" \\n—DOM IRRERA \\nThe hardest part of performing is engaging the audience. Posing the \\nattitude+topic as a question is one powerful way to get the attention of \\nan audience. \\nIt is also important to hold the attitude or the emotion throughout \\nthe entire joke. \\nWhy use such negative words? What about love?\" Nobody in their right mind will pay cover and inflated drink prices to \\nhear what comics or writers love. Look at Howard Stern\\'s high rating and \\nNou can see that people tune in to hear someone say all the stuff that \\nmost people are too polite (or scared) to talk about—lite things that scare \\nthem, that are stupid, and so on. And depending on your topic, the end \\nresult can be positive: \"Racism is stupid.\" Get it? \\n\"Not all comics say these attitude words before or in each joke. Hey, \\nJudy • • • what\\'s up with that?\" \\nProfessional comics always use attitude, even if they don\\'t actually say \\nthe attitude word itself. Usually the attitude is implied. When Jay Leno \\nsa\\\\\"s, \"What is going on with the president?\" the attitude implied is that \\nwhat is going on with the president is something \"stupid.\" He doesn\\'t need \\nto say, \"Do you know what\\'s stupid?\" Attitude can be conveyed in the \\ncomic\\'s puzzled expression or in his tone of voice. When creating material \\nit is imperative that comics starting out (like you) actually say the attitude \\nwords when creating material. In my workshops, I found that if I let stu\\xad\\ndents slide and not say the attitude words, the attitude almost always van\\xad\\nishes from their act, along with the laughs. When you\\'ve done enough \\ncomedy that having attitude in your material becomes second nature, \\nthen you can stop worrying about having the attitude words. Seinfeld and \\nLeno are at that point, but chances are that you aren\\'t. So, at least for now, \\ntrust me. \\n\"What about other attitude words, like hate, suck? / don\\'t want to \\nsound like everyone else.\" \\nThere is only one reason I use these words when coaching—they \\nwork. In the process of doing countless workshops, I\\'ve discovered two \\nthings: these attitude words bring about the best results, and even when \\neveryone starts with similar altitudes and the same topics, they all create \\ntotally different jokes. Even Beethoven started out playing scales on the \\npiano. This is the beginning of the creating process. Later there will come \\na time when we take these attitude words out, but for now, slick with the \\nProgram. Exercise: Getting Attitude \\nAdd each of the four attitude words to your topic, \"drugs,\" posing it as a \\nquestion. For instance, if your topic were \"body piercing\" your list would \\nlook like this: \\n1. You know what\\'s weird about body piercing? \\n2. You know what\\'s scary about body piercing? \\n3. You know what\\'s hard about body piercing? \\n4. You know what\\'s stupid about body piercing? \\nNow write your four questions here, using \"drugs\" instead of \"body pierc\\xad\\ning.\" \\nPractice saying the above list, emphasizing the attitude. Do not be funny \\nhere. Keep it simple. \\nComedy Structure: The Premise \\nAttitude + Topic + PREMISE + Act-out + Mix + Act-out \\nNow you are going to add a premise to your attitude+topic combo, to \\ncreate what is called the setup. \\nSETUP = Attitude + Topic + Premise \\nA premise is also called an opinion, a hit, a slant, a spin, a point ot \\nview. The premise must clearly and precisely answer the question of the \\nattitude+topic. It\\'s usually more insightful than funny. \\nHere is the setup to a Robin Williams joke; the topic is \"having kids \\nand the attitude is \"hard.\" \\n[You know what\\'s hard about having kids?] \"When you have a baby, you have to \\nclean up your act.\" \\nWilliams\\'s premise—\"When you have a baby, you have to clean up \\nyour act\"—clearly and specifically answers the question \"What is hard about having kids?\" It\\'s not funny, but it is true and insightful. A comic \\nwants the audience to relate to his premise, to feel, \"Oh, yeah! I know \\nwnat you are talking about!\" \\nIt\\'s only after Williams states his premise that he reveals the funny \\npart of the joke: \\n\"You can\\'t come in drunk and go, \\'Hey, here\\'s a little switch. Daddy\\'s going to \\nthrow up on you.\\'\" \\nWhat makes a good premise? \\na A good premise is insightful. \\n[What\\'s stupid about freebasing?] \"Freebasing, it\\'s not free. It\\'ll cost you your \\nhouse—it should be called homebasing.\" \\n—ROBIN WILLIAMS \\n• A good premise is an original observation. \\n[It\\'s weird that] \"We\\'ve gotten to the point that over-the-counter drugs are actu\\xad\\nally stronger than anything you can buy on the streets.\" \\nThat\\'s Denis Leary\\'s original hit on the topic \\nof \"drugs.\" It\\'s a simple, logical answer to \"What\\'s \\nweird about drugs?\" It\\'s also not funny. Only after \\nstating the premise does Leary go to the funny by \\ngetting specific: \\n\"It says on the back of the NyQuil box, \\'May cause drowsi\\xad\\nness.\\' It should say, \\'Don\\'t make any plans.\\'\" \\ni A good premise is very specific about what exactly is \\nhard, weird, stupid, or scary about the topic. \\n[What\\'s weird about health food stores?] \"It\\'s weird how every\\xad\\none in health food stores looks sick.\" \\n—DEBBIE KASPER \\nPremise Pop Quiz \\nractice by coming up with premises about \"relationships\": Do you know \\nwnat v weird (hard, stupid, scary) about relationships? genuine. Many comics agree thai the setup is more important than the \\nfunny part because this is where the audience decides if thev like you or \\nnot. Even when writing sitcoms, many funny scripts are rejected because \\nthey sound jokey and aren\\'t authentic to the characters. Whether writing \\nor performing, if your setup seems jokey it can turn the audience off. \\nHere is another example ol a hack premise from Tom Dreeson. \\nWrong way: \\n\"I was standing in my backyard and these aliens landed and probed me.\" \\nHack! This premise tries to be funny and winds up sounding stupid and \\njokey. There\\'s also no attitude, and this is less like a premise than like a \\nstory because il uses past-tense verbs—\"1 was standing.\" The audience is \\nthinking, \"Oh, how am I going to bear five minutes of this idiot?\" \\nThere\\'s a way to set up this premise so that it works. \\nBight way: \\n\"My uncle is so weird he thinks aliens landed in his backyard and probed him.\" \\nThis way the setup is credible and vour uncle is the weird one—not you. \\nOr you could do it this way: \\n\"Did you read that stupid article in the National Enquirer where this guy thought \\naliens landed in his backyard and probed him?\" \\nThinking in terms of what is weird, stupid, scary, or hard, rather than \\nthinking about what is funny, will free your creative process. \\nA hack premise is about you rather than an insight about others. \\n\"Isn\\'t it weird how my girlfriend doesn\\'t want to have sex?\" What do I \\ncare? I don\\'t even know your girlfriend. \\nChances are if you are using the words /, me, or my in the premise, it\\'s \\ntoo self-absorbed and won\\'t interest the audience. Start general and then \\nget to something specific about yourself, \\n\"[General] These days you have to be married or have a steady girlfriend because \\nyou can no longer have casual sex. [specific] Of course, I have never believed in \\ncasual sex anyway. I have always tried as hard as I could. No woman has ever said \\nto me, \\'Hey, you\\'re taking this casually.\\' That\\'s because I usually wear sweatpants. \\nI have black cork I put under my eyes.\" \\n—GARRY SHANDLING \\nOnce the audience is interested, you can bring in specific personal ele\\xad\\nments. But don\\'t make it into a story about \"vou.\" Comedy writing is an intense investigation into what it means to be a human being—not what it \\nmeans to beyou. \\n\"[General premise] You can\\'t spank your kids anymore because they\\'ve got the \\n1-800-CHILD-ABUSIN\\' line, [personal] My parents were so strict, my mother \\nWould say, \\'Go ahead and dial that number if you want to. Go ahead, the phone is \\nright over there. \\'Cause I\\'ll be out of jail long before you are out of the hospital.\\'\" \\n—GEORGE WALLACE \\na A hack premise is one that describes something that happened \\n(story) rather than gives an insight about what happened. \\nThe most common mistake that beginning comics make is confusing a \\nstory with a premise. Stories don\\'t work in stand-up because thev take too \\nlong to tell. \\nWrong way: \\n\"Do you know what\\'s weird about relationships? I was dating this girl and she \\ndumped me. I\\'ve been really lonely. I don\\'t know how to cook or do the bills and \\nI\\'m really desperate. I want to find someone new and I\\'ve been going out every \\nnight trying to find someone and nothing is happening. Girls don\\'t like me.\" \\n\"Oh waiter . . . check please.\" Stories are too long and boring. When the \\nseiup poses a question—\"Do you know what\\'s weird about relation\\xad\\nships?\"—the next sentence must answer it. \"I was dating this girl and she \\ndumped me\" does not tell the audience what is weird about body \\npiercing. \\nBight way: \\n\"Do you know what\\'s weird about relationships? You never meet someone when you \\nreally want to.\" \\nSec how the above cuts to the chase with the insight and avoids the \\ntediousness of having to hear \"what really happened\"? \\nGot it yet? A premise is not a description of what happened. It\\'s a cul-\\nlo-the-chase, get-to-the-point, original observation. For instance, what \\npremise could you gather from this faulty setup? \\nThe Internet is just too slow. Vou can\\'t download anything without taking a long \\ntime.\" \\nThis is just a statement of what happened, with no attitude and no premise. \\nHie first step is to give the topic—\"the Internet\"—an attitude: \"weird.\" Then drop the story and replace il with a premise, an original observa\\xad\\ntion about something specific, such as: \\n\"You know what\\'s weird about the Internet? It\\'s changed what women want in a \\nguy—women now rate men by who\\'s got the fastest Internet connection.\" \\nFor right now, you don\\'t need to know how you are going to make a \\npremise funny. Fresh observations are easy to make funny. \\n\"Women used to want a guy with a slow hand, now they want a man with a fast hard \\ndrive. \\'Ohhh, you\\'ve got a T? connection? I like a man with a lot of RAM and who \\nknows how to use it.\\' \" \\nUnderstanding the difference between a story about \"what happened\" \\nand a premise is the key to successful comedy writing. It\\'s also what \\nmakes it hard. Anyone can recite something that happened, but it takes \\nimagination and insight to come up with a good premise. \\n\"But Judy, a lot of my stories are really funny. I had a crowd in \\nstitches at a party.\" \\nThis is one of the hardest facts of comedy writing for my students \\nand other beginning comics to get: something that works at a party, a \\ndinner table, or a bar doesn\\'t ahvavs work on a stage. Many think that \\nit\\'s important to tell audiences about something that \"really happened.\" \\nWrong. Stand-up comedy is premise-based, not story-based. Students who \\nare obsessed with having to tell their stories usually get no response and end \\nup with \"Well, I guess you had to be there\" as their punch line. Not funny. \\nEven when writing scripts or essays, the same rule applies. A written \\npiece might be based on something that actually happened, but profes\\xad\\nsional writers rarely limit their writings to the simplistic retelling of a \\nstory. Structure, imagination, and artistry need to be applied to trans\\xad\\nform any story into a piece that works. \\n\"But my stories are really funny.\" \\nOK, be stubborn. Tell your really funny stories. Then, after you bomb \\non your first open mike, come back to this lesson and learn how to write \\npremises so you end up getting laughs. Exercise: Writing Premises \\nOernember bow 1 gave you the topic of \"drugs\" earlier? Write down all \\npremises below. A few tips: \\nDireetlv answer the attitude+topic question (\"Do you know what\\'s weird \\nabout drugs?\"). \\nKeep it in present tense. (Don\\'t use the verbs were, was, and so on.) \\n, Don\\'t try to be funny. \\nAvoid using the words, /, me, or my in the premise. \\nCome up with a strong opinion, an insight, an original observation. \\nludy\\'s Premises on \"Body Piercing\" \\nPiercing is stupid. It s painful \\nenough just to be in a relationship. \\nThere is no need to add to it. \\nIt\\'s hard to have everything pierced \\nbecause when you are getting \\ndressed in the morning, you \\nhave to decide not only what \\nearrings to wear but which rings \\nto put in your nose, your belly \\nbutton, and even down there. \\nIt\\'s hard being pierced when you go \\nthrough metal detectors at the airport. \\nIt\\'s hard to understand what people \\nare saying when they\\'ve got \\nhardware in their mouth. \\nIt\\'s weird to see older people with \\nnose rings. \\nIl s scary for parents to see their \\nten-year-olds get their bodies pierced. \\n11 s scary that nose rings are now an \\nacceptable business accessory, like \\ncuff links or a lie clip. \\nh S scary that kids hurt their bodies as \\n__ a way to rebel against their parents. \\nIc s stupid because it looks so \\n.^unattractive. \\nIl s hard because if you have \\neverything pierced, you have to \\nIL_b\"y more jewelry.

That\\'s why it\\'s important to do a buddy \\ncheek with each other\\'s premises before creating the funny part of the \\njoke. But it\\'s not enough for your premise to be clear just to you and your \\nbuddy. Drunken strangers have to be able to get it too. Arriving at a clear \\npremise usually lakes a bit of work. Good, authentic premises generally \\nrequire a lot of ranting and raving and plenty of assistance from your \\ncomedv buddy. Think of your original ten premises as a starting point. \\nRewrite your original ten premises on \"drugs\" by having another jam \\nsession with your comedy buddy. Turn your tape recorder on and try stand\\xad\\ning up in front of your comedy buddy and pacing, or walking, while you \\ntalk. Movement helps get die energy going. When it comes to getting into \\nyour funny /one, use anything that works except heavy drugs. They don\\'t \\nreally work anyway, except maybe with other people who are on them, and \\nit could get very expensive making sure that your whole audience is always \\n\\\\\\\\ asted. You and your buddy can take turns being the comic and the coach. \\nWhat docs a comedy coach do? \\n• Helps his buddy get unstuck by repeatedly asking, \"What\\'s weird, stupid, \\nhard, or scary about that?\" \\n• Keeps asking, \"What do you mean?\" until the premise is specific and clear. \\n• Helps his buddy find an original, specific truth or insight about his topic. \\n• Keeps his buddy\\'s energy up. \\n• Eliminates these words from his buddy\\'s premises: me, I, my. \\n• Is generous with his time and energy. (I found that the more 1 assisted \\nothers, the more 1 learned about writing jokes for myself.) \\nA coaching session on premises should play out something like this: \\n--\\'>Mi<:: Do you know what\\'s weird about piercing?

COMEDY BUDDY: OK.

Why is ft \\nstupid? \\nO ivilC: It\\'s stupid because between being in a relationship, working for a \\nstupid boss, and paying taxes, there\\'s already so much pain in your \\nlife, there is no need to add to it. \\nCOMEDY BUDDY: OK, that makes sense. Good. That\\'s clear, write that \\ndown.

Well, maybe it\\'s not stupid, but it\\'s hard to \\nhave everything pierced because when you\\'re getting dressed in the \\nmorning, you have to decide not only what earrings to wear, but what \\nrings to put in your nose, belly button, and even down there. \\nCOMEDY BUDDY: Great. That will lead to something. How about hard? \\nWhat\\'s hard about being pierced? \\nCOMIC: It\\'s hard to go through metal detectors at the airport when you\\'re \\npierced. \\nCOMEDY BUDDY: Good, that makes sense. I\\'ll write that down. \\nWrite your reworked premises on \"drugs\" below. Make sure you in\\xad\\nclude an attitude word in each premise and exclude the words / and my. Comedy Structure: The Act-out \\nSetup (unfunny) •* Act-out (funny part) \\nSo far you and your comedy buddy have developed some premis \\nabout \"drugs.\" But they shouldn\\'t be funny . . . yet. Now it\\'s time to a< \\nwhat I call an net-out to each premise. In an act-out, the comic acts out t \\nsituation of the joke and scores the big laughs. Instead of talking alio \\nsomeone or something, you perform it. You turn into the people or thin \\nvou mentioned in the setup—actually act them out. And finally, you g \\nto he funny. \\nIn the vaudeville days of stand-up, jokes were strictly setup punch liru \\n{\"Take my wife ... please!\" \\n—HENNV YOUNSMAN \\nBut now. with the popularity of improvisation and the intimacy \\nTV, the punch line has gone the way of eight-track tapes and has bei \\nreplaced with an act-out. Act-outs give comics the chance to show c \\ntheir ability to do voices and characters. \\n[Crack is stupid.] \"I would never do crack. Would never do a drug named after a part \\nIof my own ass. Someone says, [act-out] \\'Do you want some crack?\\' I say, \\'I was born \\nwith one, pal, I really don\\'t need another one. Thank you very much. If I want the sec\\xad\\nond crack I\\'ll give you a call. For right now, I\\'m sticking to the solo crack-ola.\\'\" \\n—DENIS LEARY \\nAct-outs can be short. \\n[It\\'s weird that everyone is on a drug.] \"My drug of choice is the antidepressant \\nZoloft. I think of it as an air bag for my mind. As soon as things start getting too \\nrowdy. . . [act-out] \\'Poof! . . . Aaahh . . .\\'\" \\n—DANA GOULD \\nAct-outs can be long, such as in Ellen DeGeneres\\'s \"Phone Call \\nCud \\' (abbreviated version on page 36), where Ellen acts out a six-minu \\nphone call to God asking why He made fleas. Robin Williams does a loi \\nact-out of a baseball player pleading his case to the grand jury: \\nEverybody\\'s doing cocaine now. Baseball players having to go in front of grand \\njuries, [act-out] \\'Yeah, I did cocaine. Can you blame me, though? It\\'s a slow \\n9»ddam game. Come on, Jack, I\\'m standin\\' out in left field for seven innings \\na\"d there\\'s a long white line going all the way to home plate. I see the guy puttin\\' \\nif out goin\\', \"Ha ha ha.\" And that damn music. \"Dit dit di dit. Dit dit di dit.\" I don\\'t know whether to slide or do a line, you know what I\\'m sayin\\'? People are slidin\\' \\ninto home headfirst. Yeah! \"You\\'re out!\"—\"Doesn\\'t matter, baby, I\\'m up now.\" \\n—ROBIN WILLIAMS \\nAct-outs are where you can work in your celebrity impressions with\\xad\\nout being a hack. \\n[I/I/hen people tike drugs.] \"They try and drive. They\\'ve got this idea that [act-out] \\n\"Yeah, I can drive. I\\'ve got it together, dude. I\\'m OK. If I can just find my feet I \\ncan drive.\\' Then they get out, they\\'re in the car.. . haulin\\' down the freeway, \\nthey\\'re movin\\' fast. They think they\\'re goin\\' at light speed. They think Scotty\\'s sit-\\ntin\\' next to them goin\\', [act-out] \\'Jim, you can\\'t push it any faster. It\\'s a Chevro\\xad\\nlet, Jim, you can\\'t drive it any faster than that.\\'\" \\n—ROBIN WILLIAMS \\n\"But Judy, I\\'m not very good with doing voices or characters.\" \\nThat\\'s OK, neither am I. Act-outs don\\'t have to be wild, they can be \\njust as effective and funny if they\\'re low-key \\n\"Babies don\\'t need a vacation. But I still see them at the beach. It pisses me off. \\nWhen no one\\'s looking, I\\'ll go over to a baby and ask, [act-out] \\'What are you \\ndoing here? You haven\\'t worked a day in your life.\\'\" \\n—STEVEN WRIGHT \\nDon\\'t worry about accuracy if you are acting out vour mother or \\nlather. The comedy patrol isn\\'t going to yank you offstage and say, \"His \\nmother sounds nothing like that.\" \\nActing out means that you perform what you are talking about instead \\nof just talking about it. For instance, see what telling a joke without an \\nact-out would sound like. \\nWrong way: \\n\"It Was hard having a dad as a lawyer. I had to motion for a puppy.\" \\nAlthough this is a funny idea, it didn\\'t gel a laugh. I suggested acting \\nout the scene of asking for the puppy. \\nRight way: \\n\"It was hard having a dad as a lawyer. When I wanted a puppy I had to go, [act-\\nout] \\'Dad, motion for puppy!\\' [act-out in father\\'s voice] \\'Motion for puppy denied.\\' \\n\\'Sidebar, Dad.\\'\" \\n—BARRY PRESTON In most jokes there are two characters that can be acted out. In the \\nsetup, the comic talks to the audience. In act-out, he\\'s talking to an imagi\\xad\\nnary character in a scene. For example, in the premise \"It\\'s hard being \\npierced, going through metal detectors at the airport,\" the two characters \\n,,v the pierced person going through the metal detector and the security guard. \\nThe act-out would then be: \\n\" \\'Burzzzzz!\\' [security guard] \\'Please remove all of your jewelry, miss.\\' [piercedper\\xad\\nson] \\'Oh, OK! [Then act out, removing a lot of rings in weird places.] Can you help \\nme with this one?\\'\" [You\\'ll have to use your imagination for where I\\'m pointing!] \\nAct-outs are not meant to be written out on paper; they\\'re funny in \\nthe way that they\\'re performed. \\n\"People would think before they kill someone if a bullet cost five thousand dollars. \\n[act-out] \\'Man, I would blow your f**king head off if I could afford it. I\\'m going \\nto get me another job, I\\'m going to start saving some money, and you\\'re a dead man. \\nYou better hope I can\\'t get no bullets on layaway.\\' [second premise] Even if you get \\nshot by a stray bullet, you don\\'t have to go to no doctor to get it taken out. Whoever \\nshot you\\'ll take that bullet back, [act-out] \\'I believe you got my property.\\'\" \\n—CHRIS ROCK \\nThe characters in act-outs don\\'t have to be people. They can be ani\\xad\\nmals, vegetables, minerals, or even Clod. \\n\"What is hard about dating is when you like someone, \\nsometimes they don\\'t like you back. God is messing with \\nyou. \\'Please, Sod, can I have him?\\' [in deep voice] \\'No. \\nI\\'m going to keep you liking him and he will never like you \\nback.\\' \" \\n—FALEENA HOPKINS \\nRobin Williams gives voice to a chair. \\n\"I wonder if chairs go, \\'Oh no! Here comes another asshole!\\'\" \\nRichard Pivot\\'s heart talks to him in this joke: \\n[Heart attacks are weird.] \"Your heart gets mad. \\'Thinking about \\ndying now, ain\\'t you? You didn\\'t think about it when you was eat\\xad\\ning that pork.\\'\" \"/ noticed that a lot of comics say, 7.\\' / thought that you said not to \\nuse the words I, me, or my in the premise.\" \\nYes, that is true for the premise, but not for the act-out. A joke starts \\nout general so everyone can relate, and after the premise is the time \\nto bring in the specifics about you. The lead-in to the act-out is where \\nyou get very, very specific. If the premise has the word people in it, the act-\\nout has to have exactly which people because you can\\'t act out people in \\ngeneral. \\nFor example, student Maz Jobrani starts out general. \\n\"It was hard growing up Iranian American ...\" \\nHe then brings in exactly what was hard for him and then acts out his \\nmoiher. \\n\"I could never get anyone to spend the night at our house because everyone was \\nafraid we were going to take their kid hostage. My mom would get on the phone \\nwith my friend\\'s dad. \\'Hello, Mr. Johnson? Hi, this is Maz\\'s mother. I am just \\ncalling to let you know that your son Kenny is going to spend the night at our \\nhouse. You know, he is such a handsome boy. He has a million-dollar smile. Hello? \\nHello?\\'\" \\nIf you are a writer who has no intention of becoming a stand-up \\ncomic, it is still extremely necessary for you to be able to create and per\\xad\\nform act-outs. Especially for script writers, acting out different characters \\nis a skill that is necessary when writing dialogue, pitching story ideas, and \\ncreating characters. \\nAct-out Common Mistakes \\nMistake #1: Mentioning Someone in the Setup and Not Acting Them Out. \\nYou have to be consistent. If someone appears in the setup, they have \\nto be shown in the act-out. Anybody mentioned in the set-up needs to be \\nacted out. \\nWrong way: \\n\"[Setup] It\\'s weird when you break up with someone and your friends are more \\nupset about it than you are. [set-out] I broke up with my boyfriend and my mother \\nwas screaming at me, \\'I liked him. It\\'s you I can\\'t stand.\\' \" 1 his is a poorly constructed joke because the comic set up her friends \\nhut acted out her mother. I lere\\'s a better act-out for the same setup. \\nUight way: \\n- \\'Oh no! That\\'s terrible that you guys broke up. [beat] Do you have his phone \\nnumber?\\'\" \\nOr: \\n«\\'Oh no, you can\\'t break up with him! He\\'s the one with the Laker tickets!\\'\" \\nPaul Clay sets up a joke that takes place at a Bruce Springsteen con\\xad\\ncert. So in this joke he acts out Springsteen and the audience. \\n\"[What\\'s weird is] Bruce Springsteen has kids and now he doesn\\'t give any more \\nof those four-hour concerts. After an hour and a half, he says, [act-out] \\'Are you \\nready to rock and roll?\\' And the audience answers, \\'No, Bruce, we\\'ve got sitters.\\' \\nAnd he says, \\'Oh, shit, me too. Good night.\\'\" \\nMistake #2: Setting Up One Thing and Then Acting Out Another \\nI he act-out must naturally emerge from the premise. You cannot \\nswitch attitudes or topics midstream. \\n\"Wrong way: \\n\"I think tobacco and alcohol warnings are too general. They should be more to the \\npoint. My father said, \\'Drinking will ruin your health.\\' I thought drinking would \\njust make me become the asshole my father was.\" \\nThis joke is flawed because the setup is about tobacco \\nand alcohol warnings, but the act-out then is a warning \\nfrom afather. \\nKight way: \\nWarnings are stupid.] \"I think tobacco and alcohol warnings \\nare too general. They should be more to the point: \\'People \\nwho smoke will eventually cough up brown pieces of lung.\\' \\nAnd, \\'Warning! Alcohol will turn you into the same asshole \\nyour father was.\\'\" \\n—6E0R6E CARUN \\nNot having the same characters in your act-out \\nls like watching an improv scene where the audi-GeofSeV ence says, \"Do a scene with a doctor and the queen of England on the \\nmoon,\" and the troupe performs a scene with a lawyer and the queen of En\\xad\\ngland in New Jersey. ]ust as, in a restaurant, you expect to eat what you \\nordered, the audience expects you to deliver exactly what you set up. So if \\nyour attitude in the setup was \"weird,\" your act-out needs to express \\nexactly how weird it is. And that weirdness needs to be exaggerated. \\n\"It\\'s ife/ft/when men change a baby\\'s diapers. \\'Cause when a woman changes them, \\nyou might hear: [act-out of woman cooing sweet baby talk] \\'Oh my little baby, \\ncoo-coo baby.\\' But when a man changes it, you always hear: [act-out of a man \\ngetting really weird] \\'OH MY 600! Sit still! Don\\'t move... AAAHHHHHH!\\'\" \\n—JULES ROENITZ \\nMistake #3: Going into a Story \\nA lot of my workshop students really want to put a \"this really hap\\xad\\npened\" story into their act. They make up a premise to give them an \\nexcuse to tell the story. \\n\"You know what\\'s weird about drugs is that they make people stupid. I was at this \\nparty the other night and this guy comes over and he tells me that I\\'m really ugly. \\nAnd I was so insulted, so then I . . .\" \\nWhat they do is homb, because poorly crafted stories can suck the \\nenergy out of a room. \\n\"How do I know if I\\'m telling a story?\" \\nm It you are not at an act-out within three lines—you\\'re telling a storv. \\n• If you are using the phrase \"so then I\"—you\\'re telling a story. \\nBut there is a way to structure story into stand-up. Add act-outs and \\na retort. \\n\"You know, what\\'s weird about drugs is that they make people stupid. I was at this \\nparty the other night and this guy comes over and goes, [acting out a stoned guy] \\n\\'Man, you are some ugly woman.\\' Can you believe that? So I said, [acting out your\\xad\\nself stoned] \\'Here\\'s my phone number.\\' Yeah, drugs do make you stupid.\" \\nWhen adding an act-out to a joke, the rule of thumb is that first \\nsomeone says something and then the other person (usually you) answers Ljth a snappy, unexpected retort. It\\'s best to work with your comedy \\nbuddy in coming up with these funny retorts. \\nMistake #4: Go Back and Forth with Dialogue Without a Laugh \\nSome beginning comics mistake a joke for a play and run on and on. \\nWrong way: \\n\"My mom hates my hair, and the first thing she always says to me when she sees \\nme is, \\'Oh my God! Look at your hair. It looks like a rat\\'s nest.\\' [comic] \\'Mom, just \\nstop it. You don\\'t look so good yourself.\\' [mom] \\'Last time I was here I thought \\nthat you were going to cut it.\\' [comic] \\'The only thing I want to cut is you.\\' [mom] \\n\\'I am going home if you keep talking like that. All I asked you to do was to cut \\nyour hair.\\' [comic] \\'Not until you shave that beard!\\'\" \\nBy the time you finish, nobody is going to remember what the setup \\ns. II you act out someone saying something stupid,you have to have \\nthe final say. In most cases your snappy retort ends the joke. In order to \\nfind the best retort you should try different lines because the initial one \\nmight not be the best one. After you have explored a lot of different lines, \\nnarrow it down to the funniest one and get to it. \\nRight way: \\n\"My mom hates my hair, and the first thing she always says to me when she sees \\nme is, \\'Oh my God! You still haven\\'t cut that hair!\\' And I go, \\'Sweet Jesus! You \\nstill haven\\'t shaved that beard!\\'\" \\n—NANCY MAGNEUI \\nNotice in this Robin Williams joke that every retort is a laugh. \\n\"They handed me my son. They held him up and I went, \\'My God, he is hung like a \\nbear.\\' [retort] \\'That\\'s the umbilical cord, Mr. Williams.\\' [retort] \\'Don\\'t cut that, \\nlet him dream for a while.\\'\" \\nMistake #5: Describing the Act-out Rather Than Doing It \\nBeginning comics are often reluctant to play a character, and so \\nmstead of acting out the dialogue, they describe the situation. \\nSay out loud the following two jokes. Notice the different way it feels \\nWhen you do net-outs. \\n[Without act-outs] \"It\\'s hard being a single dad because you get the neediness \\nand the pouting and the whining and the crying. Then there\\'s my son and hit \\nneeds.\" [Same joke with act-outs] \"It\\'s hard being a single dad because you get the need-\\niness and the whining— [whining] \\'I\\'m hungry. This food sucks, [crying] You don\\'t \\npay me enough attention.\\' And then there\\'s my son and his needs.\" \\n—BRUCE BLACK \\nIn the first example the comic describes what happens, and in the \\nreworked example he acts out what happens as it is happening now. \\nExercise: Adding Act-outs \\nThe way to create good act-outs is to get yourself into the comedy /one, \\ncut loose, and perform the situation verbally and physically. It\\'s best not \\nto write out your act-outs—they tend to end up sounding too literary and \\nrigid and, worst of all, not funny The best act-outs come from mindless \\nranting—where you pace and talk nonstop (with attitude) about your \\ntopic into a tape recorder. Don\\'t think funny, but rather be funny. After \\ncreating my act-outs this way, I\\'ll jot down a short phrase to remind me of \\nthe act-out, for example, \"going through airport.\" Or I say it over and \\nover again until I get it just right, and then I write it down. But I never \\ncreate my act-outs on paper. \\nGive this a go using your ten premises on \"drugs\" as a starting point. \\nGet up in front of your comedy buddy and be playful and loose. Say one \\nof your premises out loud, emphasizing the attitude, then jump into an \\nact-out—and I mean that literally. Actually jump. Physical movement will \\nhelp you to get over self-consciousness. If your act-out includes your \\ngrandmother, physically become her, open your mouth, and see what \\ncomes out of it. \\n\"My grandma could never go to a sperm bank, [with heavy Jewish accent] \\'What\\'s \\nthe matter here? Everything\\'s frozen? Nothing fresh? Oy!\\' \" \\nExplore a lot of opinions for your act-out and then narrow it down to \\nthe best one. Keep it short—have someone say something, and then you \\nrespond. Don\\'t go on too long. Get in the act-out, get out of it, and \\nnobody gets hurt. iucjy\\'s Premises on \"Body Piercing\" \\nIt\\'s stupid because just being in a \\nrelationship hurts so much, \\nworking for a stupid boss hurts, \\npaying taxes hurts. There is no \\nllL.L.J to add to it. Judy\\'s Act-outs \\n\"Oh gee, I\\'m just not feeling enough \\npain in my life. I think I need to \\npierce my tongue.\" \\nIt\\'s hard to have everything pierced \\nbecause when getting dressed in \\nthe morning, you have to decide not \\non]y what earrings to wear but what \\nrings to put in your nose, belly \\nbutton, and even down there. \"Let\\'s see, 1 got my nipple ring, my \\nnose ring, my eyebrow ring.\" \\n\"Please, I can\\'t even decide what \\nto wear in the morning, much less \\naccessorize my nostril!\" \\nlis hard to understand what \\npeople are saying when they\\'ve \\ngot hardware in their mouth. \"Arrrg, ooh, gump, hummp.\" \\n\"Excuse me, but could you lake \\nthat bolt out of your tongue and \\ntell me the specials again?\" \\nWhat\\'s weird is that in some cities \\nlike San Francisco it\\'s a popular \\nfashion. \"I\\'m going to an elegant ball. Do you \\nthink this dog collar matches my \\nnipple studs?\" \\nWhat\\'s scary is when your kids come \\nhome with their body pierced. \"Jimmie, that Batman pin is for your \\njacket, get it out of your eye!\" \\nIt\\'s scary when people in \\nprofessional jobs show up with \\nnose rings. \"We\\'ll take your appendix out in a \\nmoment, Mr. Johnson; I just got to \\nget the fishhook out of my ear \\nfirst. I wouldn\\'t want to catch \\nyour spleen on it.\" \\nIt\\'s scary that kids hurt their bodies \\nas a way to rebel against their \\nparents. \"I\\'ll show Mom and Dad. I\\'ll stick \\nsharp objects in my nose, my \\ntongue, my belly button, my \\nnipples ...\" Yeah, that will show \\nthem. Show them that they\\'re \\nright—you are a complete idiot. \\nIt bugs me because it looks so \\nunattractive. \"Judy, how do I look?\" \\n\"Like a porcupine.\\' \\nIt\\'s hard because if you have \\neverything pierced, you have to \\nbuy more jewelry. \"Do you take this woman to be \\nyour wife?\" \\n\"I do.\" \\n\"Now please put the ring on her \\nnose ...\" \\nYou might not be able to come up with act-outs for each joke, and \\nthey all won\\'t be winners. But the more you have, the more likely you are \\nto come up with at least a few finished jokes. Now vou u \\\\ it. \\nYour Premises on \"Drugs\" Your Act-outs on \"Drugs\" \\nComedy Structure: The Mix \\nAttitude + Topic + Premise (unfunny) -» \\nAct-out + MIX + Act-out (funny) \\nNot all jokes have mixes, but it\\'s a great way to sponge a couple more \\nlaughs out of your setup. A good mix is where a comic connects two ele\\xad\\nments that people don\\'t associate with each other. The laugh comes from \\nthe way the comic connects them. \"Auto mechanics always have attitude and they make us feel guilty, [act-oat of \\nauto mechanic] \\'Look at this. This is a mess. I mean, you got your oil mixed in with \\nyour water. How\\'d you let it get to this point? This is pathetic. I can fix this for \\nyou for, like, two grand.\\' [mix] Can you imagine this guy as a preschool teacher \\ngoing up to some poor helpless four-year-old? [act-out of child] \\'Teacher, I fin\\xad\\nished my finger painting. Do you like it?\\' [auto mechanic nice] \\'Look at this. You \\ngot your oranges mixed in with your greens. You\\'re coloring outside the lines. This \\nis a mess. How\\'d you let it get to this point? It\\'s pathetic. I could fix this for you \\nfor, like, two grand.\\'\" \\nMixes generally start with \"Can you imagine if\" or \"What if,\" and are \\nmost always followed by another act-out. In the previous joke, Dave \\nDeVos talks about how hard (attitude) it is to deal with an auto mechanic \\n(topic) because they always exaggerate everything (premise), and he acts \\nthat out. Then he mixes in \"Can you imagine this guy as a preschool \\nteacher?\" and does a second act-out. \\nDolphin-safe tuna. That\\'s great if you\\'re a dol\\xad\\nphin. What //\"you\\'re a tuna? Somewhere there\\'s \\na tuna flopping around a ship going, \\'What \\nabout me? I\\'m not cute enough for you?\\'\" \\n—DREW CAREY \\nLaughter is a natural response to \\nthe surprise of the mix.

You\\'ve jammed with a comedy baddy \\nYou\\'ve written out some jokes about drugs on an index card. \\nPRO TALK with Rocky LaPorte \\n\"I learned a lot by doing it and watching \\nRichard Jeni, Dennis Wolfberg, George \\nWallace, and Ellen DeGeneres when \\nihev were touring. There was such a \\ndifference from the A rooms to the \\nB rooms. I think a lot of the young \\ncomics picked up bad habits \\nwatching B room comics.\" \\nJ \\nToday you are going to put your own act aside and get some pointers \\nfrom the pros—your favorite comics. A lot of beginning comics watch \\nwhat other comics are doing and copy them. Instead, they should watch \\nwhat other comics are doing and learn from them. Draw inspiration from \\nyour favorite comics but don\\'t use any of their actual material. \\nDays 4 through 8 are going to be spent getting serious about comedy \\nby studying what works and focusing on your favorite topic—you. \\n\"But I thought you said that jokes are not supposed to focus on I, me, \\nor my. Why, then, is this section focusing on ourselves?\" \\nThe topics you are going to joke about need to be based on personal \\nthings that are near and dear to you. That is your starting point. You are \\nthen going to be guided to craft those topics into the joke format, not story \\nformat, and get imaginative. \\n[It\\'s hard being a parent] \"My kids like animals a lot so I took them to the track. \\nThey ratted on me. They go, \\'Mommy, Daddy took us to the zoo and all the animals \\nhad numbers on them.\\'\" \\n—ROCKY LAPORTE Exercise: Honing Your Act \\nThe first step to getting serious is to take all your index cards with \"drug\" \\njokes on them and toss them into a trash can. \\n\"Why? I\\'ve got some killer jokes about drugs. Why did you make me \\ndo them if you were just going to tell me to throw them all away?\" \\nProbably the biggest and hardest part of my job as a comedy coach is \\nhelping my sludents not settle for doing material that has already been \\nextensively done by other comics. \"Drugs\" is a topic that has been done— \\na lot. Whether you\\'re a comedy writer or a stand-up comic, your main \\ngoal as a creative funny person should be to create material that comes \\nfrom who you are as an individual—your persona. The point of working \\nwith an assigned topic like \"drugs\" was to help you to concentrate on \\nlearning without being distracted by a topic that was personal. Now that \\nyou know the basics of structuring jokes, it\\'s time to move on to more \\npersonal topics. So, unless you qualify to write about drugs because you \\nwere in rehab, or currently have a needle in your arm, lose the \"drug\" \\njokes or at least set them aside. It\\'s time to find your own authentic, sig\\xad\\nnature topics. Topics that aren\\'t hack. \\n\"What exactly is \\'hack material\\'?\" \\nHack is . . . \\n• Choosing \"this is something that will be funny\" topics rather than \"this is \\nsomething that really scares me.\" When a comic picks topics such as \"tam\\xad\\npons,\" \"toilets,\" or \"penis enlargements,\" he is usually picking these hack \\ntopics because of the false assumption that the topic will get a laugh. \\nCreativity is not about picking funny topics, it\\'s about making ordinary \\ntopics funny \\n• Bathroom topics like farting, pee, ka-ka, and poo-poo. Anything that \\ncomes out of a hole is hack. As loan Rivers says. \"Grow up!\" \\n• \"I eat so much roughage that I\\'m a human salad shooter...\" Too much \\ninformation! \\n• Topics that have already been done to death, such as Viagra, Asian drivers, \\ntraffic, drugs, anything about airplanes (food, bathrooms, flight atten\\xad\\ndants). , Convenience stores, McDonald\\'s, New--York-is-dilTiTent-from-L.A., and \\n\"Have you ever noticed how cats and dogs are different?\" Wow, there\\'s a \\nnew one. \\nPRO TALK with Andy Kindler, from \"Tlie Hack\\'s Handbook: A Starter Kit,\" in \\nthe National Lampoon \\n\"Celebrity trashing, talk about not needing originality! Celebrity trash-\\ninn proves it. It\\'s the comedic equivalent of shooting fish in a barrel. \\n\\'Madonna—like a virgin? I don\\'t think so.\\' Hack! \\n\"What does Dr. Ruth know about sex? \\'Stroke the \\npenis, stroke the penis\\'—she can\\'t \\neven reach the penis. \\n\"Commercials, better known as \\nthe Hack Happy Hunting Grounds. \\n\\'These tampon commercials say you \\ncan swim, horseback ride, and hike.\\' \\nWho cares? Hack!\" \\nAndy Kindler \\nIf you know the punch line to a joke before the comic says it, chances \\nare the material is hack. \\n\"Wliat are \\'authentic topics\\'?\" \\nTo connect with an audience, comics and comedy writers ncetl to find \\nthose topics that they are truly and deeply passionate about and that \\nother people can relate to. These become their authentic topics. For \\nstand-up comics, these topics form the core of their act and shape their \\nI\\'trsona. For writers, these topics form a point of view and shape their \\nvoice. All successful comedy writers started off their careers by finding a \\ntopic about themselves that is relatablc and believable. Usually it was this \\neasily identifiable personal chunk of material that catapulted them into a \\nflourishing career. PRO TALK with Michael Hand, senior rice president of comedy development, \\n20th Century-Fox TV \\n\"To do great writing, acting, and Stand-up—reveal the things that you \\nare most afraid to reveal to other people and, ultimately, probably most \\nafraid to reveal to yourself. It makes you incredibly vulnerable and it \\nmakes people want to lean in and listen.\" \\nIn an effort to have the audiences identify with them, a lot of begin\\xad\\nning comedy writers pick their topics from magazines and newspapers, or \\nuse that clever observation about \"men leaving that toilet seat up.\" If \\nonly it were that easy. The fact is, it\\'s not enough for the topic to be relat-\\nable to the public. It also must resonate with you—deeply and emotion-\\nallv. You\\'re not qualified to joke about a topic unless you have extensive \\nfirsthand knowledge about it. Being obsessed with it is even better. \\nThis emphasis on relatability and authenticity applies not only to \\nstand-up comics but to all comedy writers. Each sitcom episode is based \\non a topic that must be relatable, and each line a character utters must be \\nauthentic 10 that character\\'s persona. Even if you intend on writing cus\\xad\\ntom material for other comics, you still need to understand these basic \\nprinciples of writing from authenticity. And the best place to learn how to \\nwrite for others is to first write an act for yourself. \\nPRO TALK with Bernie Brillstein, manager who oversaw the careers of John \\nBelushi, Cilila Rtulner, Jim liaison, Dan Aykroyd, Lome Michaels, Martin \\nShort, and numerous others \\n\"You can\\'t do fake comedy today, you can\\'t do mother-in-law jokes. If \\nyou do a mother-in-law joke it has to be your mother-in-law. You have to \\nhave lived it.\" \\nNo matter how relatable your topic is, if it doesn\\'t resonate with you, \\nit probably won\\'t resonate with your audience either. Passion about a \\ntopic can\\'t be faked. The audience can sense if your topic is authentic for \\nyou or if it isn\\'t. For a long time I did this routine about my biological \\nclock running out and wanting to have children, and it always killed. \"Women in their thirties start thinking about having children, and men in their \\nthirties start thinking about dating children.\" \\nThen all of a sudden this killer routine stopped getting laughs. It was \\nnothing I did—I didn\\'t change the language, the timing, or the attitude— \\nbut ii just stopped working. Finally I realized this topic was no longer \\nauthentic to me. It was still a relatable topic, but it wasn\\'t compelling to \\nme anymore. \\nA woman in one of my workshops created her whole act around the \\nfollowing topic: \"When you\\'re an older woman, it\\'s hard to meet men.\" She \\ntlun went on to do some funny jokes about life without relationships. \\nShowcase night, the audience didn\\'t laugh, and 1 wasn\\'t sure why until I \\nfound out that she has been happily married for twenty-five years and \\nhas two daughters. Her act was based on a lie, and on some level the audi\\xad\\nence knew it. She was dishing it out but they weren\\'t buying. Cross out \\nour fake topics now—you\\'ll get more laughs later. Fake topics turn into \\nhack jukes. \\n\"Wliat about comics who just do wild, kooky things with props?\" \\nPeople can get their fifteen minutes of fame by eating lightbulbs, but \\nit usually doesn\\'t translate into a sustainable career. To achieve that \\nrequires digging deeper within yourself. \\nPRO TALK with Richard Lewis \\n\"It\\'s impossible to be as good as you can be if you hold back. If you \\nstart editing yourself, you might as well just stop, you won\\'t be as pure \\nas you can be, and why not go for the gold? You are only as authentic \\nas you allow yourself to be.

A comic\\'s first HBO special is the best because you are watching a \\none-hour presentation that probably took him live years to create. Don\\'t \\nbother studying comics after they become celebrities and host their own \\nshows because they no longer need to do personal material since the audi\\xad\\nence already knows them.

It is not that the people \\naren\\'t good, but comedy has changed a lot in the past ten years and you \\nwani to study what\\'s hip and happening now. \\nMake sure the people you watch are stand-up comics, not performance \\nartists or actors doing a one-person show. Funny people who do one-\\nperson shows—for example, Lily Tomlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Billy Crystal, \\nand Julia Sweeney—are all actors. Their work is great, but the structure \\nof a one-person show is very different from that, of a stand-up routine, \\nand so it won\\'t be of much use to you as a study tool right now.

Well, yes, they have. Except for one, \\nthat is: your life. \\nNow for something really hard—being serious for a few days. If you try to \\nbe funny while searching for your topics, you\\'ll end up sounding hack. \\nBut il you stay real and personal while finding your topics, you can dis\\xad\\ncover material that will rock. An added benefit—it\\'s better than therapy \\nand a lot cheaper. What Are Your Authentic (Signature) Topics? \\nThe questions in this section are designed to help you discover your \\nauthentic topics. When answering them, be sincere instead of funny. Later \\non you will turn these honest, authentic answers into killer comedy. But \\nfirst you x^eed to create a real, rock-solid foundation. \\nDoing that requires digging deep within yourself, then seeing where \\nthe issues that you discover lead. Always try to go deeper, to the next \\nlevel. When asked what bugs them, most beginning comics and comedy \\nwriters mention things like traffic, bad drivers, airline food, waiting in \\nline, and other overused, hack topics. Don\\'t make the same mistake. Go \\nbeyond those topics to the more personal ones—being a loser, divorce, \\nunemployment, or even being beaten as a child. \\n[It\\'s hard when four parents are older.} \"Growing up I started realizing how much \\nolder my parents were getting. I remember my last ass-whooping my dad started. \\n[aet-out of father whipping] \\'Didn\\'t I tell you . . . Whew! My back hurts. Stay \\nright there.

I\\'m going to get your father.\\'\" \\n—MIKE VouNe \\nMike\\'s joke started with the topic of \"relationships.\" The next step \\nwas to get specific about a topic. When asked which relationship in his life \\nwas the hardest for him, he said the one with his father. Continuing to get \\neven more precise, what was hard about his parents was \"having them be \\nolder\" and \"having them hit him.\" Then the premise emerged that they \\ndidn\\'t have the energy for a good \"ass whooping.\" He then added a mix, \\nbringing in a surprise element: \\n\"Now when I go into the Gap and they ask me if I want a belt with that, I say, \\'No! \\nNo! Help!\\'\" \\nIn our workshops, students can start with the same topic and all end \\nup with completely different jokes. Topics tend to start out general and, \\nafter an intense investigation, get very specific. Throw the topic of \"moth\\xad\\ners\" into a mind funnel and end up with a million particulars—foreign \\nmothers, growing up poor, mothers who smoke, critical mothers, mothers \\nwho spit, Jewish mothers, eoldhearted mothers . . . \\n\"We had a Jewish satellite dish.

We comics have artist privilege to nil the trau-\\n\\'nas of our life. Most of my students find that their parents love the \\nMention of being the foil for fun.

Write as \\nquick!)\\' as you can without correcting spelling or grammar mistakes. \\nDon\\'t worry whether it\\'s logical, funny, or even interesting. Just write \\nwhatever comes into vour head. \\nFind Your Childhood Topics \\nRead what you wrote and pick out the topics—short phrases about your \\nchildhood problems, issues, and important experiences. While picking \\nyour topics, don\\'t use the words /, me, or my—keep them general. Later, in \\nthe act-out, you will bring in specifics about you. \\nExamples: growing up poor, being a kid in New York, mom who had \\nan accent, being Japanese, father who can\\'t communicate, jealous sister, \\nspeech impediment, disabled parent, old parent, you were a bad girl, mil\\xad\\nitary father, uncommunicative father, hippie parents, lesbian mom, reli\\xad\\ngious upbringing, foreign parents, mixed ethnicity, poor family, father in \\njail.

Write premises for them using attitude words—hard, \\nweird, stupid, scary—the same way you did for the topic \"drugs.\" Premises \\nare statements of truth. Remember—don\\'t tell a story. For example, if one \\nof your topics is \"alcoholic mom,\" your premise could be: \"1 thought \\neverv mother was like that.\" How do vou write it out? \\nWrong way (story): \\n\"My mother used to come home drunk and I thought that every mother was just like \\nher. And I went over to my friend\\'s house and her mother wasn\\'t sleeping at 2 P.M.\" \\nThis has no attitude, it uses the word my, and it tells a story. \\nBight way: \\n\"What\\'s weird about growing up with a mother who is a drunk is that you think \\neveryone\\'s mother is like yours.\" \\nThere\\'s an attitude—\"weird\"—and it cuts right to the chase. I know \\nthe compulsion to tell \"what really happened\" can be very strong, but lor \\nthe sake of learning the craft, be even stronger. \\nHere are more premises on the topic of \"growing up with an alcoholic \\nmom.\" Notice thai /, my, or me is not used in the premise and that the \\npremise answers the question of exactly what is hard, weird, stupid, or scary. \\nWhat\\'s hard about growing up with an alcoholic mother is that you\\'re \\njust a little kid but you think you have to take care of the family. \\nWhat\\'s scary about it is thai they always wait until you are in public \\nto blow up. \\nWhat\\'s weird is that vou end up eating dinner in bars during happy \\nhours. \\nWhat\\'s hard about growing up with an alcoholic mother is that she \\ndoesn\\'t do a good job helping with homework. Write your most authentic and insightful premises below. Remember, \\nthis is not where you are funny . . . yet. Write ten premises about your \\nmother or your father below and leave ten lines blank. You do not have to \\ndo this all in one sitting, and it\\'s better if you fill in a few premises at a \\ntime. These should not be at all funny, but insightful. \\nFill in some of your own, but leave ten blank for your comedy buddy \\nto fill in.

Examples, \"single and dating\" topic: \\nIt\\'s hard when you like someone and they don\\'t like you. \\nPeople get weird about saving the word love. \\nIt\\'s hard to come back to dating after you\\'ve been married. \\nIt\\'s scary that if you\\'re over thirty-five and unmarried people assume that \\nyou\\'re gay. \\nExamples, \"marriage\" topic: \\nIt\\'s hard to keep romance going after you\\'ve been manied for five years. \\nIt\\'s stupid to ask someone to \"love, honor, and obey.\" \\nIt\\'s weird meeting your fiancee\\'s parents for the first time. \\nIt\\'s scan\\' that you\\'re not allowed to go out with anyone who isn\\'t a couple. \\nFill in some of your relationship premises and, again, leave ten lines \\nblank.

You know: being gav, \\ndisabled, obese (size 12 doesn\\'t count, ladies), middle aged (thirty years old \\nQoesn\\'t count, even if you feel you\\'re old), being from a different culture (except for coming to L.A. from New York because it\\'s been done \\nto death), and so on. If nothing strikes a chord here, that\\'s OK. You can still \\nbe a comic. Maybe that can be your special challenge. \\n\"I was in a school for the retarded for two years before they \\nfound out I was hearing impaired. And they called me slow!\" \\n—KATHY BUCKLEY \\n\"I was the only Jew growing up in an Irish Catholic neighbor\\xad\\nhood.

She goes, \\'But Vickie, are you a \\nesbian because it\\'s fashionable?\\' Oh right, Mom, lesbians have \\nalways been known for their fashion sense. You\\'re thinking of gay \\nmen. Say men have the fashion sense, lesbians build the runways.\" \\n—VICKIE SHAW \\n\"It\\'s hard being older. I used to take acid and now I\\'m taking antacid.\" \\n—Jupy CARTER \\nWrite special challenge topics here: \\nWrite ten premises—things that are hard, weird, stupid, or scary about \\none of your special challenges. Fill in as many or as few as you can, and \\nonce again, do not he funny; instead, be truthful and sincere. \\nYour ten premises on a special challenge: Your comedy buddy\\'s premises on your topic: \\nYour Day Job \\nMany jokes are based on things that oppress us, and one thing that tends \\nto demoralize a lot of people is their day job. Thus it\\'s very relatable \\nwhen a comic talks about stupid bosses, customers, and jobs. \\nList all of the day jobs you\\'ve ever had: waitress, lawyer, doctor, strip\\xad\\nper, auctioneer, temp, unemployed . . . \\nCircle the ones lhat you and others would consider the most stressful \\nOr the most oppressive. For instance, it might have really been a night\\xad\\nmare being a boss and having a bad secretary. But chances are the audi\\xad\\nence would be rooting more for your secretary no matter how bad she was \\nflnd less for you because it is an accepted belief that it\\'s secretaries and not \\nbosses who are oppressed. Now think of that awful job as a topic by itself and write premises \\nabout it. Keep the focus on the occupation without going into a personal \\nstory. For instance, if your day (or night) job was stripping, here\\'s what \\nnot to do. \\nWrong way: \\n\"It\\'s hard being a stripper when you have to drive so far to get to your job.\" \\nThat\\'s a faulty premise because that might have been particular to you \\nand you alone, and it\\'s not a detail about the profession. Premises are a \\ncombination of being truthful and relatable. \\n\"Wrong way: \\n\"I was a stripper and even though I had the flu I had to go on. I really didn\\'t feel \\nlike it and then I was doing a lap dance and I sneezed on this guy.\" \\nThis doesn\\'t qualify as a premise because it is a story about what hap\\xad\\npened to you and not about stripping. Here\\'s a better way. \\nRight way: \\n\"It\\'s hard being a stripper because you have to be sexy when you don\\'t feel like it.\" \\nThe audience will know exactly what yon are talking about. \\nIf your job was being a waitress . . . \\nWrong way (story): \\n\"I had this job at this cafe and there was this woman who always asked me what she \\nshould eat.\" \\nBight way (cut to the chase): \\n\"It\\'s stupid that customers ask waitresses what they think they should order.\" \\n\"Customers say some of the stupidest things. \\'This steak, it\\'s too tough.\\' It\\'s too \\ntough? Well, what do you want for $3.99? Filet mignon? This is Sizzler, you fool, \\nnot Spago. You\\'re lucky it\\'s mooing and not neighing! God!\" \\n—VICKIE RASJOHN \\nWrite premises for all the ways that your jobs were hard, weird, or scary \\nwithout using the words / or my. Examples: \\nUs weird that in I.A. all waitresses are unemployed actresses. \\nIt\\'s sany being a lawyer wkenyow clients tell lawyer jokes. \\nWluit\\'s hard about being a janitor is that it\\'s not exactly a babe magnet. Write ten premises on your day job (or jobs): \\nHave your comedy buddy write ten more premises on your topic: \\nAuthentic Topic: Your Current Issue \\nMany successful comics and comedy writers base their material, or a por\\xad\\ntion of it, on a current issue. For example: this is a time in my life when 1 \\nam dealing with being gay and coming out; being pregnant; going through \\nniiddle age; being a student; getting sober; being a foreigner. For some of \\nyou, these issues might be the same thing as your special challenge, and \\nWat s OK. Topics based on a personal issue that is also a universal condi\\xad\\ntion can lead to great jokes and later become the basis for sitcom scripts, \\nhumor essays, and motivational speeches. \\nA special challenge might be something in your life that\\'s permanent, \\nSod a current issue might be a temporary event. Robin Williams\\'s current \\nissue was his wife having a baby. \\n\"You\\'re saying, let\\'s breathe, honey, let\\'s breathe,\\' because you have this myth \\nthat you\\'re sharing the birth experience. Nope. Unless you\\'re passing a bowling ball, I don\\'t think so. Unless you\\'re gonna circumcise yourself with a chain saw, I \\ndon\\'t think so. Unless you\\'re opening an umbrella up your ass, I don\\'t think so. \\nYou\\'re not doing diddly squat, you\\'re along for the ride.\" \\n—ROBIN WILLIAMS \\nComplete this statement: This is a time in my life when the number one \\nthing that\\'s on my mind is \\nExamples from my students: \\n\"going through a divorce\" \\n\"being unemployed\" \\n\"having cancer\" \\n\"being a sober alcoholic\" \\n\"breaking up a relationship\" \\n\"being unemployed\" \\nAnd once again write ten premises about your current situation here: \\nStop here and have your comedy buddy fill in premises based on your \\nsituation here: Pay 7 Action Checklist \\nYou have ten premises each about your \\n• childhood \\nj relationships \\nQ special challenges \\n• current issues \\nFinally the moment you\\'ve been waiting for—how to turn your authentic \\ntopics into stand-up comedy material. But before you start to learn the \\nprocess, let\\'s do a reality check on your topics. Sometimes topics are so \\npersonal or unique that they actually prevent the comic from connecting \\nto an audience. It can be a real shock to find out onstage that your expe\\xad\\nriences are particular only to you and to you alone, and are totally unre\\xad\\nntable to most other human beings. There is a big difference between \\nauthentic topics that work in a nightclub setting and personal stories that \\nsound like they should be revealed only in a therapy session. \\nWrong way (unrelatable topic): \\n\"I\\'m hypoglycemic and I have to eat small meals six times a day, and it\\'s hard \\nbecause sometimes I forget!\" \\nWell, thank you for sharing. Self-absorbed topics such as this don\\'t \\nwork because it\\'s about the comic\\'s personality and not about the topic. \\n\"It\\'s hard when you get a bee sting and it makes you talk dirty.\" \\nWell, just you. A topic needs to be something that most people can \\nrelate to. Unless you are a celebrity, no one cares. Topics based on jour \\n\\' \\'ypoglycemia,your procrastinationjww eating disorder, and other personal \\nidiosyncrasies are rooted in narcissism rather than in worldly interests. Right way: \\nHaving a \"cheap father\" is something a lot of people can relate to. \\n\"My dad\\'s so cheap. He\\'s always yelling at me for spending money. \\'Look at you, \\nspending money, you\\'re such a big shot.\\' Oh yeah, buying food, paying rent. I\\'m \\njust showing off.\" \\n—CATHY LADMAN \\nPRO TAIK with Richard Jeni \\n\"I always start out with something that happened to me or something \\nI\\'ve lived. The second criterion is how much of the audience has had the \\nsame experience and is going to relate to this. The most powerful thing \\nyou can do in comedy is to have the audience relate to the material.\" \\nAuthentic topics that are also refutable \\nare interesting not just to you, but also to total strangers \\noccur in a similar fashion in other people\\'s worlds (It\\'s not just an idea \\nabout your mother, but about all mothers; it\\'s not just about you losing \\nyour job, but it is about everyone\\'s fear of unemployment.) \\n\"A\" is your authentic topics. \\n\"B\" is the buzz topics going around, authentic topics for a large number of people. \\n\"C\" is the overlap between you and the world. Fame happens when a skilled comic hits on an authentic topic thai is \\n.,|s,, hot with the audience on an emotional level. For example, Yakov \\nLrimoff was washing dishes at the Comedy Store in 1980 when he sud-\\ndeil|v hit it big because his Russian jokes became interesting to the world. \\nWhen Communism died, so did Yakov\\'s jokes—good for America, bad for \\nYakov. \\nTim Allen knocked around for years until he developed his routine \\nabout \"men using tools.\" \\n\"h \"| decided to rewire that weird little sprayer thing on the sink. It works really \\ngood with a paint compressor wired to it. I can clean my neighbor\\'s siding from \\nacross the street.\" \\n—TIM ALLEN \\nTim Allen\\'s stand-up was always funny, but focusing on the topic of \\n\"home improvement\" created stand-up material that made TV executives \\nlake notice. \"Men trying to be Mr. Fix-it\" was a very relatable topic. His \\nhew focus led to a sitcom (Home improvement), which led to starring in \\nfilms, which even led to a line of Tim Allen tools, which are sold in Kmarts \\neverywhere. Co figure. \\nSan Francisco comic Rob Becker always did well as a stand-up comic. \\nBut it wasn\\'t until he developed material based on his insightful observa\\xad\\ntions that men are hunters and women are gatherers that he started really \\ngetting attention. He said, \"When people started coming backstage and \\nwanting to meet me, I knew that 1 had hit on a nerve with this topic.\" His \\nact based on the topic eventually became the long-running Broadway hit \\nDefending the Caveman. \\nHoi topics are things that are on everyone\\'s minds, not jusl your \\nown. Stories about your life that are inaccessible to others are called jour\\xad\\nnal writing, topics only a therapist could love or musings for a captive \\nbartender. All topics need to be relatable. \\nIn this joke, when Jonathan Katx jokes about his father, he is tapping \\ninto everyone\\'s fears about their parents growing old: \\n\"My dad\\'s hearing is gone and he won\\'t admit it. When he reads, he goes, \\'What?\\' The \\nmind is slowly following. He called me up the other night, very excited. He says, \\n\\'Jonathan, when I get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I don\\'t have \\nto turn on the light, the light goes on automatically. When I\\'m done, the light goes \\noff automatically.\\' I said, \\'Dad, you\\'re peeing in the fridge, and it\\'s got to stop.\\'\" \\n—JONATHAN KATZ PRO TALK ivith Johnny Carson, quoted from The Great Comedians, by Larry \\nWilde (1972) \\n\"The greatest thing that a performer can have if he is going to be suc\\xad\\ncessful is an empathy with the audience. They have to like him ... if \\nthey resent you or if they don\\'t feel any empathy with you or they can\\'t \\nrelate TO you as a human being, it gets awfully difficult to get laughs.\" \\nRentable Topics \\nPop Quiz \\nWhich of the following topics would be relatable topics? \\n1. your bald spot \\n2. your alcoholic mother \\n3. your name \\nChoice #1—bingo lor \"your bald spot,\" a relatable topic! It has the \\nchance of making an audience laugh because it\\'s automatically authentic, \\nespecially if everyone can see your bald spot. \\n\"I guess I\\'m sensitive about my hair loss. I think everybody\\'s making fun of it. \\nI went to buy a VCR, the guy said, \\'Four-head?\\'—and I beat the hell out of him.\" \\n—DAN WILSON \\nThe topic of \"men\\'s baldness\" is also relatable, especially because \\naudiences see TV ads for hair loss drugs. Although women don\\'t often \\nhave to deal with this issue themselves, they have feelings about bald \\nmen. And all men can relate because the}\\' either worry about losing their \\nhair or are losing it. It\\'s something that is visual and is on the minds of \\nthe public. But to really work, the topic must not be so much your bald \\nhead, but rather the topic of \"baldness\" in general and what that means— \\ngetting old, vulnerability, lack of desirability, and so on. \\n\"It\\'s really hard for a black man to cover up his baldness. We can\\'t comb our hair \\nforward, we can\\'t comb our hair to the side. Somebody told me, \\'Let it grow out!\\' \\nWhat, and look like Homey the clown? I don\\'t think so!\" \\n—WOODY WOODBURNER Any joke based on something physically obvious is an authentic \\ntopic. Many comics turn their physical defects into their ticket to fame \\naiui fortune. \\n[Joking about his weight] \"I can\\'t get into that California lifestyle. I was at the \\nbeach and every time I would lie down, people would push me back into the water. \\n\\'Hurry up, he\\'s dying.\\'\" \\n—LOUIE ANDERSON \\n\"You women ever look at men\\'s bodies like they are meat? Are you ever alone with \\nyour girlfriends, like, \\'Look at that baby. USDA choice prime cut. Hmmmm.\\' My \\nbody is the part they make hot dogs out of.\" \\n—DREW CAREY \\n\"I asked the clothing store clerk if she had anything to make me look thinner, and \\nshe said, \\'How about a week in Bangladesh?\\' \" \\n—ROSEANNE BARR \\nChoice #2—\"your alcoholic mother\"—another relatable topic! Bad \\nHews is—you had a rotten childhood. Good news is—it\\'s comedy mate\\xad\\nrial! Audiences can relate even if their mothers didn\\'t have a drinking \\nproblem because we all know mothers who can be out of control and \\ninappropriate. It\\'s a relatable topic. \\n\"Drunks forget things. My mom got drunk and would forget little things like where \\nher keys are, where her kids are . .. [act-out of drunk mom] \\'Go to your room, \\nyou\\'re grounded for a week.\\' \\'Mom, we\\'re at Denny\\'s.\\'\" \\n—TRACEY ABBOTT \\nChoice #3—\"your name\"—hack! Not a relatable topic. Many begin\\xad\\nning comics who have an odd or unusual name will pick their name as an \\nauthentic topic. It usually does not work because it\\'s not what the public \\ndiinks about or cares about. After all, they just heard your name for the \\n\\'irst time—if they heard it at all. A lot of neophyte comics have a hard \\ntune believing that the audience doesn\\'t automatically care about them. \\nBelieve it. Sure, the joke you told about your name at a party might get \\nlaughs, but that\\'s because your friends know you, or because they\\'re \\nbeing polite. A club audience is never polite. To make an audience ol \\ndangers laugh, you will need to pick topics that the audience cares about \\nas much as you do. \"Wrong -way: \\n\"It\\'s weird having a name like mine—Yule Dansa. When I meet people they think \\nI\\'m asking them to dance!\" \\nWho cares! It\\'s a topic that, yes, is weird and irritating to you, but \\nnot to us. And sometimes a heckler will be happy to tell you. Next! \\nHere are some examples of unrelatable premises. \\n\"It\\'s hard getting old.\" \\nYou\\'re thirty years old, get over it! Those of us over forty would give \\nanything to have a three in front of our age. You don\\'t really know any\\xad\\nthing about this topic. \\n\"It\\'s hard being fat.\" \\nWomen, if you are a size 12 or under, you are notfat! Knock it off. You \\nmight be lull of self-loathing, but you are not full of fat. \\nExercise: Give Your Topics a Reality Test \\n\"So hoiv do you find out if your topics are relatable?\" \\nOne way is to test them out in public. Try this exercise with five peo\\xad\\nple, but don\\'t tell people you\\'re testing out stand-up comedy material. \\nThey will expect jokes, and right now you just want to sec if you\\'re in the \\nreality zone. \\nTesting your topics on the public is easy. You just ask them what they \\nknow about a topic. Ask friends, neighbors, coworkers: What do you know \\nabout [your topic]? \\nIf you\\'re met with a blank stare, then it\\'s not a relatable topic. \\nIf someone asked me what I know about \"their boyfriend Sam,\" \"their \\nflat feet,\" or \"being a compulsive vomiter,\" I\\'d say, \"Nothing,\" or, \"I don\\'t \\ncare.\" \\nBut if they asked me what I know about \"failed relationships,\" \"being \\nsick,\" \"dominating fathers,\" \"wimpy mothers,\" or \"growing up poor,\" I\\'d \\nsav. \"A lot.\" Not because they are my topics, but because they are topics \\nthat almost anyone can talk about. And in some regards, that\\'s what stand-up is—a conversation with an audience. Remember—the audience must \\ntaiv about what you are talking about in order to laugh about it. \\nSo, take your topics out for a test run. Ask people at work, at school, \\neven ask strangers. Here are some additional questions to ask people, \\nand when you ask them, tell people to be honest, or ask only people who \\nvou know will be honest. Write down what they say—and don\\'t defend \\nyourself! Reality-check questions will tell how an audience sees you. If \\none of your special challenges was \"having a big nose,\" and when looking \\nat you, nobody said, \"Big nose,\" you might want to cross that topic off \\nyour list. \\nWliat do you see when you look at me? \\nIf you were a casting director, what type of roles would you see me in? \\nExercise: Narrow Down Your Topics \\nAfter spending your day reality-checking your topics, find the winners \\nand cross out the ones that didn\\'t elicit any enthusiasm. \\nDay 8 Action Checklist \\nQ You have reality-tested your topics with at least five people. \\nQ You\\'ve asked people what they sec when they look at you. \\nf You have crossed off all unrelatable topics. \\nU You ve arranged for three consecutive jam sessions with your coniecK \\nbuddy. \\n-1 You have an appointment with a plastic surgeon. You and your comedy buddy are going to spend the next three sessions \\njamming on your premises. In each session you and your buddy are going \\nto focus on certain topics: \\nFirst jam session: \"special challenges\" and \"current issue\" premises \\nSecond jam session: \"childhood\" and \"current relationship\" \\npremises \\nThird jam session: \"job\" premises \\nTape-record each session. Sometimes material will flow out of you \\nperfectly and you will need to know exactly how you said it. Also, you \\nmight find, when listening back to these tapes, that you\\'ve recorded not \\nonly ideas that will work as jokes but ideas that can be transformed into \\nsitcom scripts, humor essays, or even bumper stickers. Save these tapes. \\nHow to Get It Funny \\nStep 1: Write Premises for Your Buddy \\nBy now, both you and your buddy should have written down ten \\npremises for each of your authentic topics. Today, go back to the pages \\nwhere you wrote your ten premises. You\\'re going to switch pages, and \\neach of you will write ten premises for the other person\\'s topics. If you \\ncan\\'t come up with any premises for one of your buddy\\'s topics (or vice \\nversa), chances are that it\\'s not a relatable topic. Maybe the topic is too \\nstory-based—like \"What happened with my boyfriend\"—and needs to be \\nmade more general, like \"mean boyfriends.\" Don\\'t try to save a topic by \\nrationalizing that it\\'s hard to come up with premises on someone else\\'s \\ntopics—I\\'ve found that most people actually find it easier. \\nStep 2: Walking and Ranting \\nIt\\'s time to shift from thinking about premises to having fun by cre\\xad\\nating the act-out. You don\\'t want to be structured about this, but then \\nagain, don\\'t get so comfortable with your comedy buddy that you just sit \\nat a table with a pitcher of beer and think about coming up with act-outs. Act-outs need to be created spontaneously and under the gun. Here\\'s one \\nway to do that. \\nPut each of your premises on an index card. Grab your tape recorder \\nand cards and go outside for a walk. Pick a card and go to a corner, then \\nwalk quickly to the next corner while ranting about that premise into a \\ntape recorder. The comedy buddy will just listen. You have to come up \\nwith a complete joke by the time you get to the next corner. It doesn\\'t \\nhave to be a great joke, but it has to be an attempt at coming up with an \\nact-out or a mix, or both. If you didn\\'t come up with anything, throw that \\npremise away. Take turns working while walking. Keep score and see who \\ngets the most act-outs per block—it makes this fun. \\nDon\\'t expect every joke to come out perfectly. I would say that on \\naverage a half-hour rant produces maybe two good jokes. Most beginners \\nexpect jokes to fall out of their mouths perfectly formed, and when that \\ndoesn\\'t happen they give up in frustration. You and your comedy buddy \\nshould help each other work through any blocks, but if some topics keep \\nhitting dead ends, then toss them. \\nWrite down the winners on separate index cards. And yes, this time \\nyou can keep them. \\nTips on Creating Act-outs \\n• Don\\'t use the words I, me, or my in the premise. When you start a joke with \\n\"Let me tell you a little bit about myself,\" you\\'re assuming the audience \\ncares about you. They don\\'t. Get personal in the act-out. \\n• Make the premise general and then get specific. You can\\'t act out \"people\" or \\ngeneral concepts. Reduce your act-out to something very specific. \\n\"[General premise] When you\\'re in a bad relationship, it\\'s hard to ignore that wise \\nlittle voice in the back of your head. Vou know, the one that\\'s saying, \\'Run, run for \\nyour life! He\\'s the devil!\\' [personal and specific] I used to think that was just my \\nfear of commitment talking. Turns out, it was his ex-wife leaving messages on my \\nanswering machine.\" \\n—SHARON HALLINSDAL \\n• Make sureyou are in fact doing an act-out and not explaining. Remember—the \\npoint of acting something out is to become the type of person you are \\njoking about rather than describing that person. \" \\'Love handles.\\' Who came up with that name? When was the last time I was with \\na woman and I stripped off my shirt and she said, [act-out] \\'Oooh, are those han\\xad\\ndles, I love those\\'?!\" \\n—TOM ALIEN \\n• Keep away from stories. If \"so then 1\" is in your joke, you have left the \\nworld of stand-up. Also, stay in the present—use \"I am\" rather than \"I \\nwas.\" Stand-up is not about what happened. It\\'s insights about the impor\\xad\\ntant and relatable topics in your life. \\n• Remember when creating act-outs that each joke needs to have a turn, a surprise, \\nor a twist. Start in reality with a grounded setup and then let yourself get \\nwild on the act-out, bringing in new elements to the joke. The act-out is \\nusually not \"what really happened\" but made-up, exaggerated reality, a \\nmajor flight of imagination. Let your mind go wild and freely associate. \\nTips on Adding Mixes—Comparison Jokes \\nLook over your jokes and add mixes to some of them. One way to do this \\nis to use comparisons. For example, compare yourself to your parents. If \\nyou do an act-out of your cheap father, you could follow up with, \"I\\'m \\nworried I\\'m becoming him,\" and do another mix. You can compare the \\npast to the present, such as, \"Before I got married I was like [act-out] . . . \\nand after I was like [act-oat].\" In this joke Carol Leifer compares what she \\nwas looking for when she was first single to how she felt six months later, \\nwhen she was desperate: \\n\"When you\\'re first single you\\'re so optimistic. At the beginning, you\\'re like, [first \\nact-out] \\'I want to meet a guy who\\'s really smart, really sweet, really good look\\xad\\ning, has a really great career. . .\\' Six months later pate like, [second act-out] \\n\\'Lord, any mammal with a day job.\\'\" \\n—CAROL LEIFER \\nYou can compare any two things—\"president of the United States\" \\nand \"your grandfather\": \\n\"Ronald Reagan was seventy-seven years old at the end of his presidency, and he \\nhad access to the button. The button! My grandfather\\'s seventy-seven, and we \\nwon\\'t let him use the remote control to the TV set.\" \\n—DENNIS MILLER Sophisticated people\" and \"rednecks\": \\n\"Sophisticated people go to art auctions. Rednecks ... we have yard sales. And \\nthe difference is ... at art auctions the sale price is slowly working its way up. \\nNot at a yard sale. In fact, if you\\'ve got enough patience, you can get a house full \\nof furniture for a buck twenty-five.\" \\n—JEFF FOXWORTHV \\nIn comparison jokes, notice how the setup and the payoff are all in \\ne same rhythm and the same length: \\n\"Articles about celebrities always exaggerate their lives, try to make them seem so \\namazing. \\'He worked three years as a dishwasher before he made it big.\\' Hey, I \\nworked three years as a dishwasher before I became a busboy.\" \\n—NICK GRIFFIN \\nAnother way to do a mix is to change the environment in the mix. For \\n\\'Stance, if the (opic is \"your self-absorbed mother,\" put her in a different \\ncupation. \\n\"Can you imagine my mother working for a suicide hot line? \\'You want to jump? So \\njump! I\\'ve got enough problems of my own.\\'\" \\nHere, comic Harland Williams puts his penny-pinching father in a \\ndifferent situation—the afterlife: \\n\"When my father dies, he\\'ll see the light, make his way toward it, and then flip it \\noff to save electricity.\" \\nGet a feel of this mix exercise by performing act-outs of the following. \\nCharacter \\nNegative Mother \\nHippie Mom \\nDrunk Dad \\nPdigious Mom \\nMarine Dad New Situation \\nas therapist \\nas president giving State of the \\nUnion address \\nas airline pilot \\nas sex education teacher \\nas Boy Scout leader Exercise: Add Mixes \\nBy now you should have a cast of characters in your act, such as your \\nmother, your roommate, your hoss. Make a list of them and play with \\nthem. Find new situations to put these characters into and act out the \\nscene. However, in the joke you have to establish them by acting them \\nout before doing the mix. \\n\"Driving with my controlling mom in the backseat is such a pleasure, [act-out of \\ncontrolling mom] \\'Oh my God, take a left. Oh my God, not that left. Right! Right! \\nStop! Stop!\\' [retort] \\'Okay Mom, we\\'re just in the driveway.\\' [mix] Can you imag\\xad\\nine my mom as an air traffic controller? [mix act-out] \\'Okay, four-oh-niner, you \\nneed to take a right. Oh no, not that right. Oh God, you need to take a left. Oh \\nno, a quick left. Bye-bye, four-oh-niner.\\'\" \\n—REBECCA O\\'BRIEN \\nCharacter \\n(e.g., Mom) Characteristic \\n(e.g., Alcoholic) Situation \\n(e.g., Performing \\nSurgery) \\nDays 9, 10,11 Action Checklist \\nQ You got together for three days of comedy jam sessions. \\nLI You and your comedy buddy exchanged premise lists and rounded off the \\ntotal of your premises to twenty each. \\n• You jammed your premises on \"childhood,\" \"love relationships,\" \"jobs,\" \\nand \"special challenges\" and have added act-outs and mixes. \\nU You found some jokes that work and wrote them on index cards. \\n• You have at least six minutes of material (or eighteen premise+act-ouis). \"1 hare jokes now on all different topics. How do I put them together?\" \\nlo figure out the order of your jokes, think of your act as a first date \\nwith someone (the audience you want to like you). You don\\'t talk about \\nyour pubic hair on a first date if you want a second one. The idea is to start \\nwith topics that are the most immediate and obvious—such as the way \\nvou look and sound, something that just happened, or something on every\\xad\\none\\'s mind—and end with more personal topics. Always put anything \\nabout sex at the end of your act; by then the audience should know you \\nbet ter (and is more drunk). You don\\'t want your audience peaking too soon. \\nII you use this structure, your topic chunks would be arranged like this: \\n1. special challenge/current issue \\n2. childhood \\n3. job \\n4. love relationship \\nFor example, an Englishwoman might start with the special challenge \\nof \"being from England and living in L.A.\" and the stupid things that \\npeople say when you have an accent. For her \"childhood\" she\\'d talk \\nabout her British mother and growing up poor in England. Her \"job\" \\ntopic could be about stupid things that customers say to a waitress in \\nL.A. She\\'d cud with \"love relationships\"—differences between L.A. nun \\nand London men. \\nFor sitcom writers, this skill of pacing material is called creating the \\nstory arch, and it will be discussed in the chapter on writing sitcoms. But \\nwhether you\\'re a comic or a comedy writer, it\\'s important to know the \\nbest way to arrange your material to keep any audience\\'s attention. \\nHow do I get from one topic to the next?\" \\nJust do it. Being off the wall is a good thing. Let\\'s look at what off the \\nWall means. Throw a ball against a wall and it hits the wall and abruptly \\nchanges directions. It\\'s human to change directions quickly and some\\xad\\ntimes you can get an extra laugh from it. Hack Attack \"Warning: Segues \\nThere is a natural tendency to want to hridge each joke or topic with \\na segue. Don\\'t do it. Most segues are hack, especially these: \\n\"And speaking of. . . \" Don\\'t try to bridge one joke 10 the next. \\n\"Tlidt reminds me of. . .\" Hack, hack, hack. \\nThere is no need for anything in between jokes. If a sentence is noi \\npart of a joke, then it\\'s part of a problem. If you feel the need to use \\nwords in between jokes, then use an attitude word to segue: \\n\"And you know what else is stupid . . . ?\" (Insert new topic.) \\n\"Another thing that is weird is ...\" (Insert new topic.) \\nSet Lists \\nSet lists are bulleled lists of your act—cue words that help vou to orga\\xad\\nnize and remember your act. They can look like this: \\n• fat \\n• Mom \\n• Kansas \\n• husband \\n• orgasm \\nExercise: Your Set List \\nArrange your set list. Put an attitude word next to each cue to remind \\nyourself to plug into the emotion. \\nYour Opening \\nA good opening gets the audience\\'s attention, defines your persona, and \\nlet\\'s them know that a pro is onstage. Audiences will decide very quicklv if \\nyou\\'re worth their attention. That\\'s why the first thirty seconds of your \\nact, the first three pages of your script, the first paragraph of your essay \\nhas to rock. PRO TAIK with comic George Wallace \\n\"lake command as you walk onstage. Your attitude \\nshould say, \\'This is my show. I don\\'t know what \\nhappened before, but I\\'m here and this is what 1 do \\nand I hope you like it.\\' I\\'m making a sales call. \\nthat\\'s all it is. Just as a salesperson, you have an \\nopening, then you present the item, you hope \\nthey buy it, they laugh, and then you sell the \\nsecond joke.\" \\nOpening Tips \\n• Start with the obvious. As I mentioned before, if there is anything really \\nobvious about you, joke about it right up front. The audience is already \\nthinking about it. so get on their wavelength. I had a little person in my \\nworkshop and she didn\\'t want to talk about her lack of height. 1 con\\xad\\nvinced her that in order to take control she would have to joke about it \\nright up front, because her audience would be whispering about it when \\nshe walked on the stage. The idea is to joke about yourself before the \\naudience does. \\n\"I used to be a waitress. Not only did I get paid \\'under the table,\\' I worked there \\ntoo.\" \\n—KATHY FOWLER \\nPRfljALK with Phyllis Oilier \\n\"The first word, that first sentence is one of the most important things \\nyou\\'re gonna do. 1 found that I must joke about something that they \\ncan look at and relate to. For example—I had a dress that was, well, it \\nlooked like upholstery, and 1 said something about how I shot my \\ncouch. Right away that\\'s a laugh.\" \\n~ Here is Louie Anderson\\'s opening line from his HBO special with \\nRodney Dangerfieki: \\n\"Listen, I can\\'t stay long, I\\'m in between meals. So bear with me on this. Let me \\nmove this [mike stand] so you can see me. Let\\'s face it, if I didn\\'t do these fat \\njokes you guys would sit out there going, \\'Do you think he knows he\\'s that big?\\' \\nLike I woke up one morning, \\'Oh no.\\' \" \\nPRO TALK with Albert Brooks \\n\"Comics make run of themselves so it gives them permission to make \\nfun of the audience. If you\\'re far, vou do fat jokes. If you\\'re Irish, you \\ndo Irish jokes. II you\\'re Jewish, you do Jewish jokes.\" \\nBe sure you know what\\'s obvious about you bv completing the \"Give \\nYour Topics a Reality Test\" exercise on page 130. You might be self-\\nconscious about something, but the audience might not notice it. On the \\nother hand, you might also diink it\\'s no big deal that you\\'re missing half \\nyour teeth, but the audience might not agree. Also, make sure that this \\nobvious aspect of yourself is clearly visible. That means jokes about your \\nbig feet are out. \\n[Indian comie] \"My name is Malik Sooch and I\\'m sure you can tell by my name \\nand the way that I look that I come from a culture that\\'s a lot different than this \\none . . . I\\'m from Indiana. This racial tension in New York has gone way too \\nfar... even / can\\'t get a taxi driver to pick me up!\" \\nPRO TALK with comic Greg Proops \\n\"Do ten or fifteen minutes up front of likable material and then go to \\nvour vile self.\" \\n• Open with something that is obvious about the room. Sometimes I dump the \\nopening I planned and start tiffing about something that just happened. \\nThings you could play off are the comic before you, the waitress who \\ndropped a tray during your introduction, the curtain behind you that is \\ncovered with stains. Whatever you decide to open with, be willing to toss it if it conflicts \\nwith the mood of the room. Get on the same wavelength as the audience. \\nIf every comic before vou opened with. \"I low are you all doing?\"—star! \\nwith a joke about that. If there is something really obvious about the \\naudience, do a joke about that. For instance, maybe there was a traffic \\njam in front of the club that night. Or perhaps the entire audience is \\nthere to see one comic and it\\'s not you. Or there\\'s a bus tour from a cer\\xad\\ntain group in the audience. One time when 1 was playing the Improv, \\nthere was a group of fifty high school students in the audience, so I \\nopened with something about that. \\nPRO TALK with Richard Lewis \\n\"I usually open up with what\\'s going on environmentally on the stage, \\nor I spot someone, or if something happened to me moments before \\nI went on or if something very newsworthy happened that day. It \\nwould be impossible for me to not talk about somediing that really \\nhappened.\" \\n• Get to vour first joke in a natural way. Audiences take lime to warm up to \\nsomeone. Don\\'t throw them a joke at the beginning that comes out of \\nthe clear blue sky. You want it to come from something real and immedi\\xad\\nate, something the audience is already a part of. Tor instance, one ol my \\nstudents wanted to start her act with, \"It\\'s hard being the middle child.\" \\nThe audience is sitting there drinking and \"growing up as a middle kid\" \\nis not on the top of their minds. Imagine that you meet someone and the \\nfirst thing that they say to you is, \"It\\'s hard being a middle child.\" It\\'s too \\nforced. So I coached her to get to her opening jokes in a more natural, \\nreal way: \\n\"A lot of the other comics have relatives here. Yeah? [audience responds] I didn\\'t \\ninvite mine because they would heckle. \\'Get off the stage, you were never the \\nfunny one.\\' And that was my grandmother, [laugh] Growing up it was hard being \\nthe middle child . . .\" \\nWith this opening she (a) acknowledged what was going on in the \\nroom at that moment (the audience was packed with other comics\\' rela\\xad\\ntives) and (b) quickly got to an act-out (acted out her grandmother). Only then did she introduce her topic. By that time the audience was \\nengaged and easily became interested in her topic. \\n• Make sure your opening sets a tone that you can sustain. Don\\'t open with a \\ndirty joke if the resi of your act is full of cute observations about dating. \\nThe tone of your opening lells the audience what to expect, and you\\'ve \\ngot to deliver those goods consistently. George Wallace lets the audience \\nknow right up front what they\\'re in for. . . and not. \\n\"I\\'m different from the other entertainers you\\'ve seen, who try to establish a rap\\xad\\nport with you and ask you questions, like, \\'How are you doing? Where are you from?\\' \\nI eould give a shit where you\\'re from. We\\'re just here tonight to have a good time, \\nright? Who\\'s having a birthday? Did they sing \\'Happy Birthday\\' to you yet? No? \\nWell, I guess you sure are out of luck because I\\'m not going to be doing it neither.\" \\n—GEORGE WALLACE \\n• Make your opening fit the circumstances. Different rooms, different audi\\xad\\nences, different nights of the week all demand different openings. If it\\'s a \\nbig showcase room and a packed crowd, I go right for a big laugh up \\nfront. But that can be too heavy-handed for a smaller audience. In that \\ncase I usually engage the audience in conversation and then slide natu\\xad\\nrally into my first big laugh. \\nRemember, that fantasy audience that howls at all of your jokes when \\nyou rehearse your act in the shower is not the audience you\\'ll be facing \\nonstage. Not only does every audience have a distinctive personality but \\nwhoever precedes you can change the audience\\'s mood in just moments. \\nFor that reason you must be flexible about changing your opening. \\nI once followed an offensive comic who talked about a certain part of \\na woman\\'s body smelling like fish. (He\\'s now working at his father\\'s dry \\ncleaning business. Smirk, smirk.) I had to acknowledge what had been \\ngoing on in the room, and I had to speak it, or as comics say, call it. I \\nopened my show, \"Oh, and now the fish is going to do some jokes.\" They \\nlaughed. I rearranged my set list and put the material about \"It\\'s hard \\nbeing a woman\" up front. It was very real. And it worked. \\nHack Attack Warning—Openings \\n\"So, let me tell you a little about myself.\" \\nHack! Don\\'t assume that the audience is interested in you. Thev are \\nnot. Matter of fact, club audiences are known to be none too caring and gupportive. And if your family is in the audience, they already know all \\nthey want to know about you. \\n\"I know what you are thinking . . .\" \\nHack! Yes, it worked for the first two hundred fat comics, who then \\nsaid, \"Anorexic.\" And for the Asian comic, who then said, \"1 hope he \\ndidn\\'t hit my car.\" But it\\'s been done to death now, and has become an \\nopening cliche. \\n>\"How are you all doing?\" \\nHack! Cliche. \"I\\'m doing the same as I was when the last eight comics \\nasked me.\" This opening is hack because (a) it shows right away that the \\ncomic has nothing original to say and (b) it is totally inauthentic, because \\nthe audience knows that the comic doesn\\'t really care about how they\\'re \\ndoing. \\n\"So, this is really true . . .\" \\nDocs that mean everything else you talk about is a lie? \\n\"So raise your hands if you are . . .\" \\nAfter paying a cover charge and ten bucks for a beer, the audience \\nfeels like they\\'ve done plenty. They don\\'t want to have to come up with \\nthe comic\\'s opening. \\nCalling the Moment \\nCalling the moment is a skill that lakes many years of performing to do. \\nIt\\'s saying out loud what everyone else is thinking to themselves—verbal\\xad\\nizing the communal consciousness, which is basically the job of a stand-up \\ncomic. For instance, I once went to see some of my workshop graduates at \\nan open mike. It was a very informal setting. A small crowd sat in a little \\nroom. The stage was just a raised platform. 1 watched in horror as each \\ncomic performed the exact same act that they did on their showcase night \\nal the Improv. Their performances were fine for a large showcase room but \\nWere way too showy and impersonal for an open mike. There was a tall, \\nneavilv made-up, big-haired woman in a scuuined gown sitting in the front row. Nobody was sure if she was really a she or a he. Hearing her order \\ndrinks in a low husky voice heightened the mystery. Not one comic \\naddressed this situation. By the time I went onstage the audience had \\nstopped laughing, or even listening to the comics. 1 threw away my \\nplanned opening and instead 1 entered into a dialogue with the lady in \\nquestion instead. I started with, \"What a fabulous outfit!\" \"What do you \\nthink about my outfit?\" \"Could you take me home and dress me?\" As \\n\"she\" answered it became clear that she was a transvestite. I then launched \\ninto some jokes about being a bad dresser. \"I\\'m not a femme fatale, but \\na femme fatality.\" Big laughs now. I didn\\'t put her down but I knew the \\naudience was focused on her and I had to call the reality of the room. \\nAn audience will judge very quickly whether you are an original with \\nsomething fresh to say or a hack. So even when your jokes are rehearsed, \\nthey have to sound spontaneous to sound real. \\nDay 12 Action Checklist \\nU written out your set list on index cards \\nJ decided on an opening \\nGet to the Funny \\nAlthough the audience where you\\'ll be performing has left their TV \\nremote controls at home, they still have a channel-surfing mind-set. \\nYou\\'ve got to get to the funny (the act-out) in just a few lines, before the \\naudience mentally changes channels. \\nExercise: Taking Out the Trash \\nToday you are going to spend time honing each joke and wringing out \\nmore laughs. \\nI. Write out your jokes, then underline the. funny part. If there are more \\nthan three lines before the funny part, you\\'re taking too long to get there. \\nCross out all the stuff you don\\'t need—including any and all hack segues. \\nBottom line: if it\\'s not part of the joke, it\\'s part of the problem. Practice by fixing this joke, taking out all the extra words and \\nfinding a way to get to an act-out as quickly as possible. \\nWrong way: \\n\"I got married last year and things haw really changed. All my other friends \\nchanged when they got married, and I never thought I would change when I got \\nmarried, but you do. In the sixties I was a political activist. I protested, marched, \\ngot arrested, and just the other day I caught myself reading Martha Stewart \\nLiving. I used to be interesting and go, \"Hell no, we won\\'t go!\" Yesterday I \\nstarted wallpapering the bedroom and I realized that now I\\'m thinking about \\nMartha Stewart, thinking, \\'Oh no, that won\\'t go.\\' Or, \\'Oh no, I\\'m going to miss her \\nshow. \\nHight way (same joke without story and extra words): \\n\"It\\'s weird how when you get married, you change. I used\\\\t> be a political activist, \\nnow I subscribe to Martha Stewart Living. Instead of \\'Hell no, we won\\'t go,\\' it\\'s, \\n\\'Oh no, that won\\'t go!\\' \\'What time is it? I\\'ll miss her show!\\' \" \\n—LEE ROSE \\n2. Make sure all your jokes are in the present tense: \"I am\" rather than \\n\"I was.\" \\nWrong way: \\n\"The other morning I woke up and although it was hot, I was cold, and I wanted to \\nput on a coat and I thought, \\'Oh no, it happened! I\\'m old.\\' And I was thinking, \\n\\'When is it that you are old?\\' Because it was four P.M. and I wanted to go to an \\nearly bird special.\" \\nRight way: \\nFix the above joke by putting it into the present tense and giving it an \\nattitude, topic, and act-out. \\n3- Check again, with as critical an eye as possible, that all your premises \\nmake sense to a group of strangers. Cross out all the premises that relate \\nonly to you and your little world. 4. Make sore every joke has one and only one attitude. Don\\'t switch atti\\xad\\ntudes in midjokc, and toss any jokes that have no attitude. \\n\"My mother is weird. It scares me that she . . .\" \\n5. Cross out any jokes that are illogical. What\\'s wrong with this setup? \\n\"It\\'s weird that everyone in Los Angeles has plastic surgery. This guy comes up to \\nme and shows me that he waxed his chest. \\'Feel this man, so smooth!\\'\" \\nThis is an illogical setup because chest hair waxes arc not plastic \\nsurgery. Your setup has to make sense. The setup should be: \\n\"It\\'s weird that men in Los Angeles wax their chest hair.\" \\n6. Break up jokes that have more than one topic per joke. Count the num\\xad\\nber of topics in the following setup. \\nWrong way (too many topics): \\n\"You know what\\'s weird? I\\'m from Kansas and I grew up on a farm with a large \\nCatholic family.\" \\nIn the setup, the audience needs to know what the joke is about. Sep\\xad\\narate each topic into separate setups—\"Kansas,\" \"growing up on a farm,\" \\n\"being from a large family,\" and \"growing up Catholic.\" \\nYou can have great jokes and still have a lousy act. Your entire act \\nneeds to make sense; otherwise you will have a comedv disconnect. \\nComedy Disconnect \\nA comedy disconnect happens when the comic fries to be funny rather \\nthan communicate ideas. Reality is sacrificed in a desperate attempt to get \\nlaughs at all costs. Some examples: \\n• The comic starts out talking about how he \"can\\'t meet any women,\" and \\nthen later on jokes about how \"hard it is being in a relationship.\" Huh? \\n• I once had a student whose primary topic was how \"hard it is to find Ms. \\nRight.\" lie went on and on about all the nightmare women he dated. \\nThen, in the last thirty seconds of his act, he did a whole riff about \\n\"being gay.\" Huh? Comedy disconnect. A woman opens her act by talking about how stupid it is when \"girls flirt \\nu> get what they want.\" Later on she does a series of jokes about how she-\\nwants to form a \"flirting school.\" Huh? Comedy disconnect. \\nPRJJJALK with Greg Proops \\n\"You have to be sincere and talk about what\\'s real for you. Don\\'t be \\nsexy and then talk about how you\\'re not getting dates. Or if you seem \\nsmart, don\\'t talk about nonsense. Don\\'t be afraid to talk about what \\nyou really think.

Never sacrifice a character\\'s reality for the sake of a laugh. \\n\\' creates a comedy disconnect. \\nExercise: Comedy Disconnects \\nWith your comedy buddy, do a reality check on your act and make sure \\nthat everything makes sense—and be on the lookout for comedy discon\\xad\\nnects. \\nCutting Jokes That Will Make the Audience Turn on You \\nThis is a comic\\'s worse nightmare—being despised by everyone in the \\nroom. I\\'ve seen it happen at our showcases—a comic is killing, and then \\nthere\\'s that one hostile joke, and the audience turns, and no matter what \\nthe comic does, he cannot bring them back. \\nThis applies to stand-up comics and comedy writers. One racist, sex\\xad\\nist, or offensive joke in your writer\\'s sample package can be the rotten \\napple that spoils the entire package. \\nJoke Fairly \\nAudiences generally turn if they feel that a joke is unfair. Audiences have \\na communal sense of fair play They will laugh at whoever you arc trash\\xad\\ning as long as ihey feel that it is deserved. They will turn on you if you are \\nnot fair. For instance, what is wrong with these jokes? \"I was going out with this stupid woman. This woman was so stupid that she had to \\nstudy for a Pap smear.\" \\nWhat\\'s wrong with this joke—besides being hack—is that the audi\\xad\\nence thinks, \"If she is so stupid, then why are you going out with her? She \\nagreed to go out with you, so shut up!\" The number one rule about trash\\xad\\ning something or someone is that you need to prove in your setup that \\nthey deserve it. \\nWrong way: \\n\"My wife is such a bitch.\" \\nThe audience will hate you. \\nBetter way: \\n\"My wife ran off with my best friend. What a bitch!\" \\nBight -way: \\n\"My wife ran off with my best friend. How could I be so stupid? I should have \\nknown!\" \\nWhy is this the right way? Because the best person to poke fun at is \\nyou. That\\'s how to get the audience\\'s sympathy. Make your premises \\nreflect the ultimate insight that the reason your life is screwed up is that \\nyou are the one who screwed it up. And what do you know-—it\\'s probably \\neven true. \\nThis premise can create more jokes, such as: \\n\"My wife ran off with my best friend. How could I be so stupid? I should have \\nknown the relationship was over when she told me, You\\'re a worthless piece of \\nscum and I never, never want to see you ever again.\\' But no, I thought she was \\nplaying hard to get.\" \\nAnd you can get more jokes out of it by going: \\n\"I should have known when she gave me a restraining order.\" \\nNow fill in the rest to get the feel of this. \\n\"My wife ran off with my best friend. How could I be so stupid! I should have \\nknown when . . .\" •) \\n3 \\n4. _ • \\n5 • \\nThis technique of lighthearted sell-mocking is a skill that will increase \\nyour likability whether you\\'re performing at a club or pitching your script \\nideas at a meeting. \\nDon\\'t Trash the Oppressed \\nPRO TALK with Tom Dreeson \\n\"There is no such thing as a victimless joke. Each joke has a target and \\nyou have to make sure that whoever or whatever that target is—they \\ndeserve it.\" \\nNever further oppress someone who is already perceived as being \\noppressed. Make sure the butt of your joke deserves your barbs. This \\nmeans getting out of your narrow little world and knowing who audiences \\nperceive as being oppressed. For instance, you might be a boss and have \\nthe worst secretary in the world. Tempted to joke about how hard it is to \\nget good help? Don\\'t do it. First of all, you have the power to fire her and \\nhire someone else, so what\\'s the problem? But even more important, it\\'s \\nmean to make fun of people who get paid a lot less than you do. The \\naudience will not take your side. \\nOnly trash a minority if you are a member of that group. Chris Rock \\ncan talk about things he doesn\\'t like about black people and he sounds \\nhip and cutting edge. If you\\'re white and you do it, you sound like an \\nignorant, ugly bigot. That goes for all minority groups—religious, sexual, \\nracial. \\nHack Attack Warning—Gender Bashing \\n\\'\\' you think the problem with your relationships is that the gender vou relationships and you will understand how bogus this notion is. \"Women \\nare impossible.\" \"Men are clueless about relationships!\" Hello! It\\'s not \\njust men or women who are horrible in relationships, it\\'s all human \\nbeings. \\nI he truth of the matter is that the reason your relationships don\\'t \\nwork out is you! Take some personal responsibility and stop gender bash-\\ning in comedy clubs. It\\'s hack! \\nMy job as a comedy coach is to help my students get to a deeper level \\nof truth, because there is a direct correlation between the level of insight \\nand the volume of laughter. Underneath hostility is fear. Try it on for size \\nChange \"I hate men (or women)\" to \"Men (or women) scare me.\" It will \\nmake a huge improvement in your work. \\nGender Bashing \\nWrong way: \\n\"Women just want men for their money. Last time I had sex, my girlfriend said, \\n\\'Wait a second, I need to run your credit card.\\' \" \\nThis premise is hack because the last time the comic\\'s thinking was \\neven remotely insightful was in 1950, maybe. But now women have well-\\npaying jobs and marry for reasons other than financial security. Here is \\nthe same joke reworked to be a bit hipper by making the comic look like \\nthe idiot. \\n\"Women just want me for my money. I mean, I\\'m making $15,000 a year now. Hey! \\nSo, I was with this woman and she ran my TRW and I said, \\'See, women just want \\nme for my money,\\' and she said, \\'No, I\\'m a prostitute and you can\\'t afford me.\\'\" \\n—DON ASKEW \\nExercise: Cutting the Hostility \\nIdentify who or what is the victim in each joke. Take the jokes that make \\nfun of other people or groups and rework them so that you are the butt ol \\nthe joke instead. If you do decide to trash someone, make sure you\\'re jus\\xad\\ntified doing it and that the audience will agree. Here black comic Paul \\nMooney trashes shock-radio DJ Howard Stern for a good reason. \\n[Referring to a news item that a black man found the cure to AIDS] \"Howard \\nStern said, \\'No black man discovered no cure. They can\\'t even discover something to keep their hair straight.\\' And I said, \\'You go \\nback and you tell that motherf**ker \\nI said, \"Oh no? Niggers have a cure \\nfor that, too. We will f**k all the white \\nwomen and make sure all our kids have \\nstraight hair. \\n—PAUL MOONEY \\nPaul Mooney \\n\"VV/irtf about using props?\" \\nProps usually aren\\'t worth the schlepp and can ruin your timing when \\nvou go looking for them. They also create a disconnection from the audi\\xad\\nence. Rather than slwmng the audience the big stupid hat your mother \\nwore, describe and mime it. You\\'ll most likely get a bigger laugh if you \\nleave the prop to the audience\\'s imagination. \\n\\'What about doing blue material?\" \\nIn case you haven\\'t heard, blue material consists of swearwords, \\ngraphic sexual descriptions, and other things generally not found on \\nSesame Street. Many beginning comics will use blue material because cer\\xad\\ntain words and graphic images will often get a sort of nervous, knee-jerk \\nlaugh because of the shock value, even if the joke is not displaying any \\nskill, talent, or originality. Although HBO is filled with comics doing very \\ngraphic material, they usually got there by being able to also work clean. \\nGenerally speaking, working clean opens the door to more opportunities. \\nAnd then by the time you get your own HBO special, you can do what\\xad\\never the f**k you want. \\nThe topics you choose to joke about can make the difference between \\na career as a TV comic and one as a \"May I take your order, please?\" \\nComic. Beginning comics often pick topics such as body parts, body func\\xad\\ntions, and sex because they think that they\\'re funny. Yeah, funny if you can \\nfind a paying audience of thirteen-year-olds. Many talented comics get \\npassed over for jobs because all their jokes arc X-rated. I once saw a comic \\nat an open mike who was brilliant. I\\'ll never forget him—each of his jokes \\nWas beautifully crafted with magnificent imagery. Besides being hysteri\\xad\\ncally funny, his insights were extraordinarily perceptive. But his sole topic \\nfor his entire thirty-minute act was oral sex. Five years later I ran into him again. lie was appearing nightly at the House of Pancakes—an inter\\xad\\nnational gig! ferry Seinfeld, on the other hand, is famous for always doinp \\nsqueaky-clean material, and look at his career. It\\'s your choice. \\nJUDY\\'S BLUE MATERIAL RULE \\nII your topic is something that comes out of a hole—forget it, too \\ngraphic. That includes solids, liquids, and gas—that\\'s right, no fan \\njokes. Going into a hole—OK. \\n1 \\nAnother thing to consider when doing graphic material—it may be \\nvery funny, but it might not fit with the rest of your act. For instance, I \\nsaw a clean-cut college guy who did some very funny lighthearted mate\\xad\\nrial about living with his girlfriend, then threw in an oral sex joke. It got a \\nbig laugh, but he couldn\\'t get a laugh after that. The reason—the audience \\nhad thought he was a wholesome guy and didn\\'t want to see him as a sex\\xad\\nual predator. I Ie sacrificed his likability for the sake of that one joke. \\n1 laving a naturally dirty mouth, I found it an interesting challenge to \\nclean up my act for the corporate market. It took a lot more work to get \\nkiller laughs when I couldn\\'t use the \"seven dirty words.\" However, clean \\nmaterial is not necessarily good material. A lot of people, myself included, \\narc far more disgusted by so-called clean comics who tell sexist, racist, and \\nhomophobic jokes than by brilliant comics who use colorful language. In \\nthe end, what matters most is being truthful to who you are and using the \\nlanguage that is most natural for you. \\nExercise: Getting an R Rating \\nInsecurity is the most typical reason that comics use the f-word in their \\nacts. (I\\'m calling it the f-word because I want my book to be in the \\nlibrary.) Go through your act and see if you can replace those four-letter \\nwords with more attitude in your delivery. Unless you\\'re committed to a \\nsleazy, scatological persona, cut all graphic sexual material. \\nFor Women Only \\nWhen I first started doing stand-up, there were only a handful of us \\nfunny gals out there—loan Rivers, Totie Fields, Phyllis Oilier, and others. \\nAnd our premises basically consisted of \"\\\\lv husband is an idiot.\" \\n\"Men are idiots.\" \\n\"I can\\'t get a guy.\" \\n\"I\\'m fat and ugh. \\nTraditionally, women stand-ups have limited themselves to doing mate\\xad\\nrial about their relationships or about their bodies, making their defects \\nthe butt of the joke. \\nThe new crop of female stand-ups is broadening the scope of what \\nwomen talk about. \\n\"The Second Amendment gave us the right to bear arms in order to have a ready \\nmilitia.

Wherever you arc, you can rehearse. But it\\'s \\nhelpful to prepare with your comedy buddy \\n\"How do I memorize my act?\" \\nBreak your act into chunks that make sense, such as the four cate\\xad\\ngories—special challenges, childhood, current issue, and relationship. Rehearse \\none chunk at a time, keeping the following in mind: \\n• Never rehearse vour act without emotion. \\n• Always picture what you are talking about. Visualizing who and what \\nyou are talking about makes material more dynamic and immediate. \\n• Don\\'t practice in front of a mirror or a video camera. You won\\'t be look\\xad\\ning at yourself when you perform, so don\\'t do it while you rehearse. \\nI practice while walking in an alley Nobody sees me, and even if they \\ndo, I just look like another ranting bag ladv wildly gesticulating and talk\\xad\\ning out loud to myself. 1 go through my act one joke at a time, asking \\nmyself after each one, \"Do 1 like what I\\'m saying? Is this material comfort\\xad\\nable?\" When a joke feels awkward and I just can\\'t memorize it, I toss it. \\nThere comes a time when you know your act but keep rehearsing it out \\nof fear of forgetting material. Don\\'t ovei-rehearse your act. It\\'s OK not to \\nknow it perfectly. No one is going to say, \"Well, you were real funny, but you left out a joke.\" Your act will never go the way that you imagined it \\n«iyway, so memorize it well enough not to have to struggle to remember \\njt—but also know how to let go of it so you can swing with the moments. \\n\"WJmt do I wear?\" \\nHack attack warning! \\nFunny clothes—hack! If your clothes are funnier than you are, then \\nyou\\'ve got a big problem. Wear something that makes you feel good—it \\ndoesn\\'t always have to be the same thing. \\nHaving said that, do make sure your clothes match your persona. If \\none of vour topics is about being an accountant, a conservative outfit \\nwould fit. However, if you\\'re talking about being a poor student, don\\'t \\ncome to the club in your Armani suit. \\nAlso, have your clothes match the club. You\\'ll look hack if you walk \\nonstage at Bubba\\'s House of Ribs dressed in a sequin-studded, Cher-type \\ngown—unless, of course, you\\'re a guy. \\nIf your clothes stand out, you have to do a joke about them. 1 once \\nsaw a comic wear tight spandex workout pants onstage. He didn\\'t get \\nmany laughs, mostly because the audience was distracted by what seemed \\nto be quite a large package of malted milk balls in his pants. The big laugh \\nwent to the comic after him, who said, \"How many of you think that was \\na sock in there?\" \\nPRO T/UK with Beth Lapides \\n\"Wear what you feel comfortable in. Some comics feel good in tight, \\nclothes. Some in loose. Bobcat wears hats, which is saying, \\'I see myself \\nas a clown.\\' I bring changes of clothes with me because I don\\'t know \\nhow I will feel when I get to the club. Although, I find that white is \\nvery unfunny.\" \\n\"What if I forget my act?\" \\nWhat\\'s the number one fear of doing stand-Up? Survey says—forget-\\ntlng your act. Everyone who has ever contemplated doing stand-up has \\n\"»aginea the horror of going blank, standing there drenched in flop sweat \\nas the audience stares pitifully at you. The easiest way to deal with this tear is to change\\' the way you look at it. The fact is, memory loss and the \\nhumiliation that goes along with it can be funny. All comics forget their \\nacts at some time or another. Comics who have a healthy sense of humor \\nabout themselves not only can survive forgetting their acts, they can \\nmake it work for them by joking about it. Rob Becker turned his stand-up \\nact into the hit one-person show Defending the Caveman. He blanked out \\nduring one performance at Dallas\\'s Majestic Theater and got laughs from \\nthe way he handled it. He simply announced, \"I forgot my next line.\" He \\nthen walked to the side of the stage, where he consulted with someone \\nbehind the curtain. I Ie came back out and said, \"It just came to me! A lot \\nof times you go for a walk, and it comes to you.\" The audience roared \\nbecause, actually, everyone loves mistakes. \\nLook at it this way. What are most of your jokes about? How imper\\xad\\nfect and stupid we human beings are, right? Forgetting your act is just \\nanother example of that. Ironically, it\\'s often the comics who do their acts \\nperfectly who don\\'t score the big laughs—they\\'re too slick. \\nGenerally speaking, the reason a comic forgets his act is that he is dis\\xad\\nconnected from his material. Fear causes this disconnection. The moment \\nhe admits that he is a scrcwup is the most real moment of his act. and \\nmakes him likable, human, and funny. \\nTips on forgetting your act: \\n• Let go of your obsession with being perfect. Make your inner critic accept \\nthat you might go blank. Being perfect might get you an A in high school \\nmath but it will only get you an A-nal retentive in stand-up. \\n• If you do go blank onstage, have a sense of humor about it. Use the \\nmoment to joke about what a jerk you are. It\\'s a great way to get the \\naudience\\'s sympathy. \\n• Take in a deep breath, and then let it all out. If you give yourself a \\nmoment to breathe, your act will generally come back to you. \\n• If you leave out material when performing, it\\'s probably a good thing. \\nWhen comics skip material, it means that it wasn\\'t right for that crowd. \\nTrust your instincts. \\nPRO TALK with David Brenner \\n\"When you get on that stage, you really got to feel that you own it. \\nPeople have to know that they are in your domain.\" Pay 14 Action Checklist \\nQ got your set list together \\n• rehearsed your act \\nQ decided what to wear \\nThis is the day you and your comedy buddy do your dress rehearsal. \\nYou\\'ll be performing your act just as if it were the real show, down to \\nwearing the outfit you selected. This is not a time to be adding new mate\\xad\\nrial to your act, but rather a chance to get comfortable with what you \\nalready have. \\nTiming Your Act \\nMost open mikes give new comics between three and ten minutes to do \\ntheir stuff. Whatever you do—don\\'t go over. Because if you do, no matter \\nhow funny you were, you will always be remembered as the comic who \\nscrewed up the schedule. Get in, get out, and nobody gets hurt. \\nIt\\'s better to come in short than to go too long. Don\\'t try to cram too \\nmuch material into too little time. This is not the only time you will per\\xad\\nform. If you are supposed to do five minutes, come in at four minutes in \\norder to leave time for laughs and riffing. And if there are no laughs, \\nyou\\'ll want to get off the stage at four minutes anyway. \\nExercise: Timing Your Act \\nHave your comedy buddy time your entire act. Then time your last piece \\nand practice getting to it from any point in the act. Let\\'s say your last bit \\nis thirty seconds. When you get to the club, before you go on, ask the \\nroom manager to cue you when you have one minute left. When you get \\ntoe light, you\\'ll have thirty seconds to finish the joke you are on, and \\nmove on to your last joke. The formula for figuring out when the room \\nmanager should cue you is the time of your last joke plus thirty seconds. \\n\"How do I enii my act?\" Put your most physical and/or sexual joke (or what you think is your \\nbiggest laugh) at the end of your act. But if you get a big laugh and vou \\nare anywhere near the end of your act, say, \"Thank you, good night!\" and \\nquit while you\\'re ahead. The goal is not to get in all your material, but to \\nget out while the getting is good. Always make it clear that you are fin\\xad\\nished by saying, \"That\\'s it!\" or, \"Thank you.\" It\\'s unprofessional to just \\nwalk off the stage without signaling to the audience for applause. \\nHack Attack Warning!—Hack Closings to Avoid \\n\"Well, that\\'s my time!\" \\n\"Thank you and God bless.\" \\n\"I\\'m out of here.\" \\n\"There\\'s the light!\" \\n\"You guys have been great!\" \\n\"How do I deal with hecklers?\" \\nMost novice comics are afraid of hecklers—they imagine that some \\ndrunken stranger is just waiting to humiliate them while they just stand \\nonstage tongue-tied. The truth is, this particular nightmare rarely occurs. \\nMost audiences are too shy to speak up even when asked a question, let \\nalone to shout insults at the comic. During the few times that someone \\nhas talked to me, I\\'ve actually found it fun to take a break from doing my \\nmaterial and improv with them. \\nHere are just a few of the reasons why you shouldn\\'t be afraid of \\nhecklers: \\n• You\\'ve got a mike and are louder than them. \\n• They\\'re drunk and hopefully you\\'re not. \\n• You usually have the audience on your side. \\nThe best wav to handle a heckler is to let him or her dig their own \\ngrave. They don\\'t need much help to make themselves look stupid. One \\ntechnique is to repeat what they said and comment on it by applying the \\nbasiv stand-up techniques of premise, act-out, and mix. Here\\'s an example. \\n[Heckler] \"That really sucked.\" [Comic] \" \\'That really sucked.\\' Thank you for such \\nan astute review of that joke. \\'That really sucked.\\' Very good, sir. [premise] With \\ncommentary like that you could be working for Meet the Press, [act-out] \\'What do \\nyou think of the new federal budget?\\' \\'Well, that really sucked.\\'\" If you get stuck, a \"Thank you for sharing\" or \"Oh, stop it, Mom\" can \\nbe enough. It\\'s a little hacky, but will work until you get confident in \\ncoming up with your own. If the person is really intent on ruining your \\nshow, signal the room manager to throw them out. It\\'s not good business \\nif one person ruins the show for everyone. \\nPRO TALK with George Wallace \\n\"IT someone has time to yell at you during your act, there is a reason for \\nthat. It usually means that there is a hole in your act. Notice that \\ncomics who don\\'t have hecklers are coming up with good material. But \\nsometimes there is one idiot in the audience. There are manv wavs to \\ndo if, hut it depends on the moment whether you do it with kindness \\nor embarrass the heckler. You can say, \\'Hey, people are coming here and \\npaying to see me, not you.\\' Or say, \\'The people next to you are think\\xad\\ning:—\\'Three thousand people in this room, and I had to sit next to the \\nasshole.\" \\' \\nHack Attack Warning!—Heckler Put-downs \\n• Keep away from the cliche comic put-downs—\"This is what happens when \\nthe fetus doesn\\'t gel any oxygen.\" \"You are two tacos short of a combo \\nplate.\" These lines should have rim shots after them, they are so old. \\n• Keep your integrity intact by not going for a racial or gay put-down. \\n• Male comics—don\\'t bash a woman even if she is drunk, ugly, and stupid. \\nIt will make you look even worse. \\n• Don\\'t get sucked down to die heckler\\'s level. They might be mean, but \\nyou need to be clever. \\nExercise: Handling Hecklers (Buddy Exercise) \\nYou\\'ll feel even more confident if you have some of vour own heckler \\nStoppers in your hip pocket. Practice doing vour act while your Corned) \\nbuddy heckles you, and come up with some responses you like. Even if \\nyou are quick witted, take your time before responding so you don\\'t say \\nsomething so mean that it turns the room against you. Breathe. Exercise: Practice Being in the Moment \\nThe best responses to a heckler are thought of in the moment. They are \\nfunny because they are spontaneous. I lere is a way to train with your \\ncomedy buddy to be quick on your feet. \\nComplete this list, adding ten of your own scenarios: \\n1. Crash! The waitress drops a drink tray. \\n2. It\\'s really hot in the club. \\n3. Your By is open. \\n4. The MC mispronounces your name. \\n5. Nobody laughs at your jokes. \\n6. The microphone breaks. \\n7. No one in the front row speaks English. \\n8. A waitress stands right in front of you. \\n9. A woman drops her purse and all the coins fall out. \\n10.

This exercise is also \\nvery helpful to writers when preparing to pitch story ideas, because in a This is the big day, but not big enough to call in sick at work so you can \\npractice your five minutes for eight straight hours. One run-through this \\nmorning is enough. Otherwise you\\'ll end up sounding like RoboComic. \\n\"Can I bring my set list up onstage?\" \\nTry not to—it will stop you from connecting with the audience. If \\nyou simply can\\'t go onstage without it. then stick it in your pocket or \\nWrite it on the side of a water bottle. But don\\'t pull it out unless you get \\nhopelessly stuck. And if you refer to it, be sure to make a joke about it. \\n[Looking at her set list, which was written on her hand] \"This is my Palm Pilot.\" \\n—BRAND/ NI6HTINGALE, FIRST TIME ONSTAGE \\nI wouldn\\'t suggest writing your list on the palm of your hand— \\nespecially if you tend to sweat. Suddenly your set list looks like abstract art. \\n\"Do I need to watch the comic that\\'s on before me?\" way, producers can be like drunk hecklers, and anticipating things going \\nwrong can help you to be prepared for the worst. (\"We\\'ve already done \\nthat story, what else do you have?\") \\nDay 15 Action Checklist \\n• You limed your act. allowing lime for laughs and riffing. \\nrYou figured out when to tell the room manager to cue you so you have \\ntime to get to your last joke, do it, and get offstage without going over \\nyour allotted time. \\n[J You practiced responding to hecklers and different situations. \\nYes, because you have to make sure they are not doing any of your \\njokes. Nothing is more embarrassing than to see a comic hit on a topic \\nthat\\'s just been done and done and done. No matter how great your take \\non it is. the audience is tired of the subject and you\\'re setting yourself up \\nfor comparison. \\nThere are some pros who do not like to go near the room before thev go on. Andy Kautman was like that. He would Slav clear of the room until \\nthe moment he walked onstage because he didn\\'t want the audiences \\nmood to dictate, or even influence, his act. However, the likelihood of the \\ncomic before him playing the conga drums and lip-synching the Mighty \\nMouse theme was pretty much nil. Personally, I like to take the tempera\\xad\\nture of the room before I go onstage. \\n\"WJtat do I look for when checking out the room?\" \\nCheck for: \\n• Burned-out topics. If the past three comics all joked about the same cur\\xad\\nrent-event topic and you\\'re planning on opening with that, do yourself a \\nfavor and drop it. The audience is probably burnt out on that topic. \\n• Something that is happening in the room that you can riff off. \\n• How drunk the audience is. \\n• What kind of act went on before you. The worst thing is going after \\nsomeone who stole your material. If you didn\\'t watch their act,you look \\nlike the thief when you do your act. This really happened to me. Hello. \\nJudge Judy. \\nPRO TALK m0i johnny Carson, quoted from The Great Comedians, by Larry \\nWilde (1972) \\n\"Your delivery can save you if the material isn\\'t up to par. It always \\namazes me when I see guys working in front of an audience and they \\nare not going—they don\\'t seem to realize it. They plunge right on doing \\nthe routine, like, \\'I\\'m going to do this folks, come hell or high water,\\' \\nrather than change it and going into different areas.\" \\n\"Is there a way to prevent my material from being stolen?\" \\nUnfortunately, material gets stolen all the time because there is no \\nway to register it and it\\'s too expensive to sue someone. Also, a lot of \\ntimes jokes aren\\'t stolen, it is just that several comics came up with the \\nsame joke. This has happened to me. A woman once accused me of steal\\xad\\ning her material, so I mailed her a video of me doing the joke on TV, way \\nbefore she thought of it. That\\'s one reason why it\\'s good to save dated videotapes of your performances—they come in real handy it\\' there\\'s a \\ndisputed joke. If you catch another comic doing your material and you\\'re \\njure there\\'s no way they could have come up with the joke independently, \\nask them to stop, or if thai doesn\\'t work, get a Mike Tyson look-alike to \\nasiv them to stop. If you discover that several people are doing your mate\\xad\\nrial, then it\\'s more likely that your material isn\\'t very original. \\n•\\'Should I riff off the comic before me?\" \\nYes, as long as you don\\'t say anything derogatory about their act or \\ntheir talent. Rilling oil their topics, clothes, or anything that happened is \\na bonding experience. Dissing your brothers and sisters, however, is stu\\xad\\npid. Five years from now you might need to suck up to them in order to \\nguest on their talk show. So be nice. \\nSome additional tips for tonight: \\n• Tape-record your act. \\n• Stay out of the way of the business. You\\'re not playing Carnegie Hall. \\nThe club makes its money by selling coffee, beer, or liquor, not bv helping \\ncomics. Stay out of the waitresses\\' way and don\\'t be a pest. \\n• DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL before you go on. It will ruin your edge. \\nIt\\'s OK to be nervous. As a matter of fact, having an edge is absolutely \\nessential if you\\'re going to be funny That nervousness will translate into \\nIexcitement when you hit the stage. Yes, it feels uncomfortable until then, \\nand getting wasted may seem like a great idea, but just one beer can ruin \\nyour timing. Don\\'t do it. \\nBreathe. If you have the confidence to take one full inhale and exhale in \\nbetween a joke, consider yourself successful. Breathing helps with timing \\nand can prevent a corned)\\' disconnect. \\n• Don\\'t go over your time. If you have a three-minute slot, don\\'t do four \\nminutes. As.I mentioned before, it doesn\\'t matter how well you do. Go \\nover your allotted time and you will be forever known as the person who \\nnussed up die lineup. \\n• After your show, drink as much as you possibly can. \\nWow do I stop from being so nervous?\" \\nRather than trying to stop yourself from being nervous, change your \\nAttitude about it. Being nervous can be funny, while being calm, together, \\npnfident, and perfect can be a bore. Richard Lewis, funny—the pope. not funny. Being nervous mightfeel uncomfortable, but nobody has ever \\ndied from it. If you are worried about dry mouth, then take water onstage \\nwith you. Also, pinching your check creates saliva, but do it before you go \\nonstage. \\nSometimes you\\'ll have to wait hours before you go on and you might \\nfind yourself getting really nervous. One way to center yourself is to get \\nstill, close your eyes, breathe deeply, and focus on trying to hear your \\nheartbeat. Do this for at least two minutes when you find yourself getting \\nbent out of shape. \\nA word of warning—don\\'t let your fear turn into hostility as a defense \\nmechanism. The audience shouldn\\'t be punished just because you\\'re \\nnervous. \\n\"Should I stand still, or move? Hold the mike, or keep it in the \\nstand?\" \\nIf you have to ask, keep the mike in the stand. This will keep you \\nfrom pacing, which can make you look nervous—not good if you are \\nbeing videotaped. It also frees up both your hands to gesture during the \\nact-outs. I usually keep the mike in the stand except when I\\'m doing a big \\nact-out. \\nPRO TALK with comic Greg Proops \\n\"When doing short sets, have brief setups, leave the mike in the stand, \\nand let your whole personality come out in the jokes.\" \\n\"I\\'m too nervous. I\\'m a writer, not a performer. I\\'m going to skip doing \\na show.\" \\nSorry, but you need to perform even if you are a writer because writ\\xad\\ners need to know how to engage an audience. Let\\'s face it—show business \\nis all about putting on a show, whether it\\'s in front of a nightclub audience \\nor network executives. It\\'s all about selling your goods—your act, your \\nsitcom script, or your talking toilet paper invention. All the same rules \\napply—be yourself, have fun, and connect. OK, party time is over. Back to work. Whether you bombed or killed \\nat your open mike, reviewing and reworking your act is absolutely essen\\xad\\ntial. This is what separates the pros from the wanna-bes—a thorough \\nscrutiny of your performance. Doing stand-up well requires constantly \\nreworking jokes. One word can sometimes make the difference between \\nsilence and the big guffaws. \\nProfessional comics want to know why a joke didn\\'t work and how to \\nfix ii. They\\'re willing to expend the time and energy necessary to perfect \\ntheir craft and solve the problem. Comic wanna-bes, on the other hand, \\ngenerally go, \"I hate myself, let\\'s get drunk,\" when a joke doesn\\'t work. \\nPros don\\'t take bad jokes all that personally—it\\'s about the material. \\nAmateurs take it all too seriously and make it about themselves or about \\nthe audience—\"They really sucked.\" \\nPRO TALK mth Phyllis Diller \\n\"I never, ever come off and blame the audience. I have the same reac\\xad\\ntion whether I had a good show or a bad show. After a bad show I want \\nto know what I did wrong, or after a good show, why was it so good?\" \\nBecoming a successful stand-up is like becoming successful at any\\xad\\nthing else—you must be professional and learn your craft. There is a rea\\xad\\nson why jokes don\\'t work. Let\\'s figure it out together. \\nPRO TALK with Richard Jati \\n\"It was really a matter of going out to clubs every single night and try\\xad\\ning stuff out and taping it and honing and refining it over a couple of \\nyears. If you took the time that you spent sitting around during the day \\nthinking about it, and the time that you spent trying it out, and the \\ntime you spent listening to the tape, and what the attrition rate is and \\nwhat actually makes the cut, it came out to twenty-Two hours for every \\none minute that made it into the show.\" Exercise: Reworking Your Act \\nLisren to your tape with your index cards in hand. Separate your cards \\ninto the Got Big Laughs pile and the Needs Work pile. Take the jokes \\nthat worked and put them aside. Now let\\'s focus on the clunkers. But \\nbefore we play Can This Joke Be Saved? let\\'s go over the basics. \\nPre-show \\n• Did you center yourself? \\n• Did you check out the room? \\nLI Did you drink alcohol? \\nThe Opening \\nDid you: \\n• open with something interesting to the audience? \\nIQ riff off the comic before you? \\n• call the moment? \\nU mention the obvious? \\nLI say something that alienated the audience right at the start? \\nJ connect to the audience? \\nQ have a clear attitude for your first joke? \\n• take the lime to breathe? \\n• get hostile to the audience? (If so, was it because you were nervous?) \\nYour Material \\nNow let\\'s turn to the jokes themselves. Go through this checklist with all \\nthose in your clunker pile to find out why they didn\\'t get a laugh. \\n• Did the joke have attitude? Remember, no attitude means no laugh. Did \\nthe attitude continue through the whole joke? Jokes without consistent, \\ncontinuous attitude are usually stories, not jokes, and should be tossed. \\n• Was the topic relatable? Maybe that topic was wrong for that particular \\naudience but could work with a different crowd. As you gain more expe\\xad\\nrience vou will find that each audience has its own personality, and some\\xad\\ntimes dial personality clashes with yours. No matter how much you dish it out, they\\'re not going to be buying. U Was there an act-out? That\\'s what gets the big laughs, so make sure most \\nol your jokes have them. \\nQ Was there an element of surprise in the joke? Did you do more than just \\na funny story? Was there a mix thai no one expected? \\n• Were your jokes based on stories, or on premises? \\nLI Did you take more than three lines to get to the funny part? \\nQ Did you pause after the joke, giving time for the audience to get it? \\nEliminate Stories \\nHack attack warning—stories suck. \\nDespite my many warnings, there\\'s a good chance that a story has \\nsnuck into your act. Many beginning comics have this conviction that \\ntheir life is just so damn funny, and like them, you\\'ve probably been sav\\xad\\ning up all these hilarious stories for years, just waiting for the time vou \\nactually do stand-up. I know it\\'s hard to give them up. I have sympathy— \\nreally. But that doesn\\'t change the fact that hysterical stories that kill at a \\nparty usually die at a comedy club. Save those stories to put in a one-\\nperson show, a humorous essay, or a novel, but get them out of your act. \\nPop Quiz \\nWhich of the following arc not topics for stand-up? \\n1. airlines \\n2. cancer/AIDS/death \\n3. a funny story about your breakup \\nAnswer: \"airlines\" and \"funny stories\" are not good topics for stand-up. \\nChoice #1—\"airlines\"—hack, done-to-death topic. \\nChoice #2—\"cancer/AIDS/death\"—funny. Steve Moore, a comic liv\\xad\\ning with AIDS, built his II1JO special around this topic. \\n\"When I got AIDS I put a bumper sticker on my car. It says, \\'Lose weight now, ask \\nme how.\\'\" \\n—STEVE MOORE \\n\"I am a writer/producer/director/breast cancer survivor. Don\\'t feel sorry for me. \\nCancer was easy—turning forty in Hollywood, now that\\'s a fatal disease!\" \\n—DEVO \"It\\'s time for me to get a drink of water. I figure this stuff is safe. Actually, I \\ndon\\'t care if it\\'s safe or not, I\\'d drink it anyway. You know why? Because I\\'m an \\nAmerican and I expect a little cancer in my food and water. I\\'m a loyal American \\nand I\\'m not happy until I let government industry poison me a little bit every day. \\nLet me have a few hundred thousand carcinogens here, [drinks the wafer] Ah, a lit\\xad\\ntle cancer never hurt anybody. Everybody needs a little cancer, I think. It\\'s good \\nfor you. Keeps you on your toes. I ain\\'t afraid of cancer. I had broccoli for lunch.\" \\n—GEORGE CARLIN \\nChoice #3—\"funny story about your breakup\"—not funny. \\nAlthough the topic \"relationship breakups\" is a good topic, a story \\nabout it most likely won\\'t work in a club setting. One problem beginning \\ncomedv writers sometimes have is telling stories about their families, rather \\nthan molding their family stories into premises that others can relate to. If \\nyour material is dependent on an audience having to spend Thanksgiving \\ndinner with you to understand your jokes—keep your day job. \\n)oke writing is topic based, not stoiy based. If you have a funny story \\nabout, let\\'s say, your grandmother, you will have only one hit on that \\ntopic. If your topic is \"grandmothers\" you will not be limited by \"what \\nreallv happened.\" Still, it is through our stories we can iind topics to fea\\xad\\nture in our act. \\nExercise: Stories \\nThis exercise will illustrate the difference between a story and a prem\\xad\\nise. Stories can be converted into stand-up topics if you are willing to \\nthrow away the plot of the story (what really happened) and concentrate \\non finding the premise (the point of the spiel). \\nLook at this story and see if you can find the topic. \\n\"I was watching a football game with my wife and she doesn\\'t really understand the \\ngame because she said to me, \\'Why does number 78 keep patting number 22 on the \\nbutt?\\' And she thinks that it\\'s a gay thing, and I said, \\'It means good job.\\'hi she \\nsaid, \\'Nooo! There\\'s something going on, and I think number 88 is jealous!\\'\" \\nIriis topic is • \\nDo you notice the following? \\n• h takes a long time lo get to trie funny part. \\n• There is no way to do another hit on a story. • Stories lack altitude. \\n• Stories use past-tense verbs. \\n• The words / and mc are in the setup. \\nThe topic of that story is not really \"football\" but \"how women see \\nthings differently.\" The premise of that story could be \"Women think in \\nterms of relationships. To them everything is a relationship.\" \\nHere is the same story put into stand-up comedy format. \\n\"Women think in terms of relationships. I\\'m watching football and my wife sees a \\nplayer pat another player\\'s butt, and she thinks they\\'re in love, [act-out of wife] \\n\\'Number 22 and number 78 seem very close to each other.\\' Or I\\'m watching bas\\xad\\nketball. \\'Do Shaq and Kobe get along with each other? They seem mad.\\' To women \\neverything is a relationship, [mix] They could be watching a sunset, \\'Oh, look how \\nthe sun is kissing the ocean.\\' \" \\n—THOMAS TAILARINO \\nJokes need to be concern rated. Audiences don\\'t care about what \\nreally happened in your life. They want you to get to the point, and sto\\xad\\nries take too long to get there. \\n\"But a lot of comics tell stories.\" \\nDon\\'t be misled. The brilliance of a Jerry Seinfeld, Bill Cosby, or \\nRichard Pryor is that they make it appear as if it\\'s a story coming off the \\ntop of their head, when it\\'s actually a finely crafted series of jokes. \\nHere Jerry Seinfeld\\'s topic is \"bathrooms.\" Examine how he breaks \\ndown this topic into premises, not stories (premises are italic). \\n\"Don\\'t like other people\\'s showers because you can never adjust the temperature \\nright. I don\\'t know the ratio on the dials. Sometimes a sixteenth of an inch is a \\nthousand degrees. Gotta get out of the way of the water. \\n\"There\\'s always that little hair stuck on the wall of somebody else\\'s shower. \\nYou wanna get rid of it but you don\\'t want to touch it. \\n\"I don\\'t know how it got up that high in the first place. Maybe it\\'s got a life of \\nits own, and I don\\'t want to get involved. You got to aim the shower head at \\nthe hair but that never works. You got to get a pool of water from under the shower \\nover to the hair. You get it down a foot at a time, like this. The hair is hanging on. \\n\"But we have to fight these battles. We are all alone in the bathroom. What\\xad\\never goes wrong, you have to handle it. Did you ever go to a big party, go in the \"In 3 test program, forty drugstores in Washington State will be dispensing morn\\xad\\ning-after birth control pills without prescription. In fact, men can buy them in \\nspecial gift packs with cards that say, \\'Thanks, maybe I\\'ll call you sometime.\\'\" \\n—JAY LEMO \\nTV audiences will change channels if they\\'re not interested in Jay\\'s \\ntopics. So, popular topics equal higher ratings. Popular guests raise those \\nall-important ratings points too, including many comics. And comics who \\njoke about the topics that the audiences care about and can relate to have \\na much better chance of getting on Tlie Tonight Show than those who don\\'t. \\nAll comedy writers need to have their finger on the pulse of the cul\\xad\\nture. As part of your ongoing homework, you must read an assortment of \\nnewspapers and magazines, watch TV, go to movies, and eavesdrop. \\nHow to Pick Current-Event Topics \\nWhen creating material based on nonpersonal topics, the usual rules \\napply \\nTopic Rule #1: Don\\'t pick a current-event topic because you think it\\'s funny. \\nProfessional comics don\\'t pick a topic based on its humor quotient. \\nThey pick a topic because: \\n• They have an interesting opinion about it. \\n• They have personal experience with it. \\n• They have a passionate attitude about it. \\nThere is no such thing as a funny topic. I can\\'t tell you how many \\npeople come up to me and say, \"I\\'ve got an idea for a comedy routine— \\n\\'Girl Scout cookies—S\\'mores!\\' So, what do you think?\" \\nI think, \"I\\'d like to eat some.\" \\nThere are no funny ideas. It\\'s what you do with an idea that makes it \\nfunny. \\nPRO TALK with Steven Wright \\n\"As an exercise I pick unfunny topics and see how I can make them \\nfunnv.\" When writing jokes for others or writing for TV, you won\\'t have the \\nluxury of even picking your topic. As a corporate speaker, I am given top\\xad\\nics to make funny. The topics themselves are extremely unfunny. For \\nnstancc: \\n. uses of titanium dioxide in paint pigmentation (Kerr-McGee Corp.). \\na aerospace, Mir space station (Boeing) \\nB potatoes (National Potato Council) \\nNot a knee-slapper in the lot. But my job isn\\'t talking about the \\nthings I find interesting. I\\'m paid to customize my humor to fit the needs \\nof these companies and be clean at the same time. It\\'s a real challenge for \\na ti ashy-mouthed woman like myself. Here are some examples of the \\njokes 1 tame up with on those topics. \\nTopic, \"uses of titanium dioxide,\" for Kerr-McGee Corp. \\n\"It says in your newsletter that \\'titanium dioxide has microscopic hiding power.\\' \\nGreat! I\\'m going to put some on my ass! \\'Hey, Judy, you look great! Jenny Craig?\\' \\n\\'No, titanium dioxide!\\'\" \\nTopic: \"Mir Russian space station,\" for Boeing. \\n\"What\\'s going on with that Mir space station crashing into the docking ship? It\\'s \\nweird because ground control said it was absolutely human error. The astronauts \\nsaid it was absolutely mechanical failure. But one thing I know for sure—being a \\nRussian space station, Absolut had something to do with it!\" \\nTopic: \"potatoes,\" for the National Potato Council, at Disney World. \\n\"The potato needs more PR, maybe a theme park: Potato World with Spud Moun\\xad\\ntain . . . Potatoes of the Caribbean!\" \\nOkay, they\\'re not knee-slappcrs, but the farmers laughed and the \\ncheck cleared. \\nTopic Rule #2: Don\\'t pick weird topics, but rather have unique opinions about \\nordinary topics. \\nNovice comedy writers often pick the weirdest news items (\"There is \\nnow an animal Prozac\") to discuss. \"Wrong way: \\n\"Prozac is too expensive, so I\\'m taking animal Prozac. It\\'s okay, but now I squeal \\nlike a pig!\" \\nThis open-miker created a false premise because she wanted to \\nwork her \"funny\" impression of a pig into her act. But it didn\\'t work, \\nbecause even though the pig impression was sort of funny, the joke wasn\\'t \\nauthentic. \\nHack Attack!—Current-Event Topics \\nHack topics—\"penile implants,\" \"masturbating monkeys,\" \"tampon \\ncommercials.\" If your topics are funnier than you, you\\'ve got a problem. \\n\"Tobacco companies still can\\'t admit that nicotine is addictive. Some moron from \\nR. J. Reynolds said, \\'It\\'s all relative. I heard carrots were addictive.\\' Oh really? \\nI\\'ll tell you something right now. No matter how many carrots you\\'ve had, and no \\nmatter how bad your carrot habit becomes—you\\'re never going to have to eat one \\nthrough a hole in your neck.\" \\n—HEATHER ROUNDY \\nExercise: Finding the Hot Topics \\n1. Go to your neighborhood newsstand and make a list of the topics on \\nmagazine covers. \\n2. Eavesdrop on the conversations at your local coffee shop. \\n3. Write down the topics von talk about with your friends on the phone. \\n4. Subscribe to a national newspaper like the Australian. \\n5. Set up your Internet start page to show the day\\'s top news stories. \\nExercise: Writing Current-Event Material (with Comedy Buddy) \\nBoth you and your comedy buddv take a sheet of paper and rip it up into \\nten small squares. On each one, write down a current news topic. All \\nthese topics must be happening now, they can\\'t reflect last week\\'s news. \\nYour topics can be political, such as elections, politicians in trouble, or \\ninternational conflicts. Or they can reflect lifestyle trends, such as a new \\nlad diet, a unique fashion style, or the latest hot movie or band. But all \\nol them have to be topics that most people have heard about—new \\nadvances in the field of ichthyology don\\'t fit the bill. \\nNow, put your pieces of paper with their current-event topics in a bag. and have your comedy buddy do the same. Both of you will pick one \\ntopic from the other\\'s bag and work with it for the rest of this exercise. \\nYou may feel that you can\\'t find anything funny about the topic you have \\ndrawn, and may want to switch to another one. Don\\'t. Commit to this \\ntopic for the length of this exercise. Neophyte comics tend to switch top\\xad\\nics before they\\'ve even had a real chance to explore them because they\\'re \\nafraid they can\\'t immediately come up with material. When you\\'re a staff \\nwriter for The Tonight Show, you don\\'t have the luxury of waiting for funny \\nnews or easy topics to come along. You have to produce every day and it \\nhas to be funny This is an opportunity to stretch your creative muscles, \\nlake it. \\nWrite down your topic below: \\nMy current-event topic: \"NASA space program\". \\nExercise: Topic Rants \\nStanding in front of your comedy buddy, rant about your topic, using \\nattitude. When you rant, let yourself get angry—yell, talk fast, and pace. \\nDon\\'t give descriptions or, Clod forbid, tell a story. Rather than being \\nfunny, be emotional. Tape-record these sessions and listen back to see if \\nthere are some ideas you can use. With your comedy buddy, arrange your \\nmaterial into the attitude+topic+premise + act-out+mix structure. \\nHere are some more ideas on writing current-event jokes. Remem\\xad\\nber that the jokes won\\'t just come out of you fully formed and perfect. \\nIt\\'s a numbers game. The more you write, the better your chances are of \\nScoring. \\nI. Add an attitude (weird, stupid, scary, ox hard), and push your topic into an \\ninteresting premise (opinion). \\nWrong way: \\n\"What bugs me about the space program is that I was reading the newspaper and I \\nsaw that all the astronauts were men and . . .\" \\nCome up with a specific opinion. \\nBight way: \\n\"What\\'s weird is that the space program doesn\\'t have many female astronauts.\" Another way to come up with your premise is to react to other \\npeople\\'s opinions. First repeat what you read or heard and then give your \\nhit or opinion on it. \\n\"You\\'ve heard people say, \\'All Sod\\'s children are beautiful.\\' All 6od\\'s children are \\nnot beautiful. Most of Sod\\'s children are, in fact, barely presentable.\" \\n—FRAN LEBOWITZ \\n\"Congress voted against a proposal to have a national seven-day waiting period to \\nbuy a gun. Is a week a long time to wait to see if a former mental patient is qual\\xad\\nified to own an Uzi? Come on, it takes three weeks to get a phone!\" \\n—JIMMY TINGLE \\nDrive your premise to an act-out. Here\\'s mine on the space program. \\n\"It\\'s weird because any woman would give anything to be weightless. \\'How much do \\nyou weigh, Judy?\\' \\'Nothing!\\'\" \\nRepeat this exercise two more times on the same topic, with a differ\\xad\\nent attitude: \"It\\'s stupid because . . . ,\" or, \"It\\'s hard because . . .\" Keep \\npushing to an opinion, and then drive it to an act-out. \\n\"What\\'s weird about the space program is that they are sending old men into outer \\nspace. If they can\\'t find their socks, how the hell are they going to find Mars?\" \\nFind a mix by bringing in another element. With authentic jokes, the mix \\nusually goes from the personal to the global. With current-event jokes it\\'s \\nthe reverse—they often start off global and then get personal. \\n\"[Global] The Hew York Times said that another woman has revealed that she had \\nsex with President Clinton, [personal] I\\'d never run for president. I\\'m scared no \\nwoman would come forward and say she had sex with me.\" \\n—GARRY SHANDUNG \\nComic Steve Marine! supplied this excellent current-event exercise: \\nRead USA Today. Pick one story from it and break it down into bullet \\npoints. For instance, if the story is about \"The President has been found \\nto have illegal campaign contributions,\" the bullet list might be: • when they found il out \\n• who is accusing him \\n• who the illegal contributions were from \\n• how the president is responding to it \\nlake each bullet point, turn it into a premise, and create a payoff. \\nDo this exercise with the rest of your buddy\\'s topics. Out of all these \\nrantings, select three jokes you think will work and write each on a sepa\\xad\\nrate index card. I usually write down the setup but not the act-out \\nI because writing the act-out seems to diminish the joke\\'s spontaneity. \\nThese index cards will stack up, and before you know it, you\\'ll have a \\nchunk of current-event material! \\nDay 19 Action Checklist \\nQ You\\'ve done the \"Topic Rants\" exercise with all ten of your comedy \\nIbuddy\\'s topics. \\n• You have at least three solid topics with at least three good hits (prem\\xad\\nises) on each of them. \\n• You have written at least three jokes on separate index cards. \\n• You\\'ve created three minutes of current-event jokes. \\nPie best way to stand out creating comedy material is to create soulful \\nand insightful premises. To recap, a premise is an insight about your \\ntopic. It usually answers the question \"what\\'s weird, hard, stupid, or scary\" \\nabout that subject. The way you answer that question is what separates a \\ncomic who gets laughs from a comic who gets laughs and gets jobs. To be \\na hip and happening comic or comedy writer, your premises need to \\nexpress uniquely original insights. The following, on the other hand, are \\npremises heard over and over at open mikes everywhere. \\nHack Attack Warning!—Premises \\nC L.A. is very different from New York. \\nQ I\\'m half Jewish and half Italian. That means . . . \\n^ Dating is hard because men and women are different. (Duh!) I lard to be more boring than that. These kinds \\nof cliche premises arc generally used as preambles \\nto some \"really funny\" (not) story about something \\nthat \"really happened\" (who cares?). If being a suc\\xad\\ncessful stand-up was that easy, all the restaurants in \\nL.A. and New York would be drive-throughs or cafe\\xad\\nterias because there wouldn\\'t be anv waiters. \\nLet\\'s look at the kind of premises that the pros \\ncome up with. \\n\"They\\'re trying to put warning labels on liquor saying, \\'Caution, \\nalcohol can be dangerous to pregnant women.\\' That\\'s ironic. If it \\nweren\\'t for alcohol, most women wouldn\\'t even be that way.\" \\n—RITA RUONER \\n[People say stupid things about homelessness.] \"Considering the harm people do \\nwhen they work, laying on the sidewalk is not so bad.\" \\n—FRAN LEBOWITZ \\n\"I honestly believe if you make the death penalty a little more entertaining and \\nlearn to market it correctly, you might just be able to raise enough money to bal\\xad\\nance the stupid, f**king budget.\" \\n—GEORGE CARLIN \\n\"It doesn\\'t matter what temperature a room is.

Later \\nin tHis book, you writers will learn how basing sitcom scripts on cutting-\\nedge premises is key to getting your scripts read and sold. \\nWorking smart means taking risks because you have to give up \"being \\nfunny.\" It means working close to the edge of where comedy meets \\ntragedy. The closer you can get to that line without tripping and falling \\nover, the more brilliant you will be. The danger of walking that tightrope is \\nthat you might bomb. There\\'s no safety net with brilliance. But the best \\nand brightest comics take that risk because they are more committed to \\ntheir vision and their voice than they are to being liked by the audience. \\n\"Animals have two important functions in today\\'s hectic society: to be delicious and \\nto fit well.

It was \\nBob Hope who noticed. Of course he would, he is such a construction\\xad\\nist. He goes for six a minute and he realized I was getting twelve. But \\nthere is a secret to how you do it! Topper, topper, topper. Most comics \\ndo setup, payoff, setup, payoff, in other words six jokes per minute. In \\nmy case of twelve, one setup got twelve payoffs.\" \\nHere are the twelve jokes that put Phyllis Diller in The Guinness Book \\n,,f World Records. \\nSetup: \"I\\'m so fat that. . .\" \\n1. It\\'s Jcll-O with a belt. \\n2. When 1 sit down it lakes the whole mess five minutes to settle. \\n!. When 1 take my girdle off, my feet disappear. \\n4. In a bikini I look like a bear in a jockstrap. \\n5. We didn\\'t have a sunken living room till I arrived. \\n6. Now we have a Persian throw rug—I sat on the cat. \\n7. My dress size is junior. . . missile. \\n8. When 1 wear a white dress we show movies on it. \\n9. 1 ate my doormat—thought it was a Triscuit. \\n10. I put my makeup on with a roller. \\n11. When I blew my nose downtown, a construction crew broke for lunch. \\n12. I went on the Scarsdale diet—I ate Scarsdale. \\nPRO TAIK with Richard Jcni \\n\"Once you get the audience fixated on a certain topic, why let \\'em go? \\nYou want to be pounding and hammering on a topic and get that \\nmomentum going. If you do an act where each joke is a setup and then \\na punch and then another setup on a different topic and punch, then \\neach one of those individual jokes better be really good. They each have \\nto stand on their own and there are very few comics that can pull dial \\noff.\" People\\'s attention spans are short. It\\'s not easy to find a topic that really \\nengages an audience, so once you do get a topic that clicks, get all the \\nmileage you can out of it with a topic run—a chunk of material in which \\na comic gets a multitude of hits, or laughs, off one topic by using different \\npremises on the same topic. Jerry Seinfeld is a master of the topic run. He finds funny in the \\nsmallest detail of his topic. He notices and expands upon the minutiae of \\na subject that most people ignore. Good comics pay attention to the \\ndetails of life, whether it\\'s a person, an incident, or a moment—and then \\ndissect them into microscopic particles. Jerry Seinfeld just doesn\\'t tell a \\nstory about \"going to a drugstore.\" Instead, he breaks down the topic \\n\"drugstores\" into specific premises. \\nExercise: Topic Runs \\nExamine this Seinfeld routine and underline his premises about the topic \\nof \"drugstores.\" \\n\"I went into the drugstore last week for a cold medicine and I was totally over\\xad\\nwhelmed by it. I\\'m trying to break it down. I mean there are six thousand products \\nthat are perfect for me. This one is quick-acting, but this one is long-lasting. \\nWhen do I need to feel good, now or later? \\n\"Ever catch yourself reading ingredients at the drugstore? \\'Three-point-oh \\ntetrahydrozaline. That\\'s a good amount of that.\\' They know we don\\'t know. They \\nmake up words. They always tell us on TV, \\'Now with an extra drop of retzin.\\' Like \\nwe\\'re all going, \\'Well, finally we\\'re getting some more retzin.\\' \\n\"They always tell you how the medicine works on TV. You know, the commer\\xad\\ncials, that\\'s my favorite part, where the guy says, \\'Here is the human body.\\' It\\'s \\nalways this guy, no face, mouth open. This is how drug companies see the public. \\n\"Then they tell you about the pain-relieving ingredient. It\\'s always extra-\\nstrength. There is no more \\'strength\\' anymore, you can\\'t even get \\'strength.\\' \\n\\'Strength\\' is off the market, it\\'s all extra-strength. \\'I need extra.\\' \\'What is extra?\\' \\n\\'Well, it\\'s more. We\\'re gonna throw a little extra your way. Don\\'t say anything \\nabout it.\\' \\n\"Some people aren\\'t satisfied with extra, they want the maximum. \\'Give me \\nthe maximum-strength. Give me the maximum allowable human dosage. That\\'s the \\nkind of pain I\\'m in. Figure out what will kill me and then back it off a little bit.\\' \\n\"And why does that pharmacist have to be two-and-a-half-feet higher than \\neverybody else? Who the hell is this guy? \\'Clear out, everybody, I am working with \\npills up here. I can\\'t be down on the floor with you people. I\\'m taking pills from \\nthis big bottle and then I\\'m gonna put \\'em in a little bottle. And I\\'m gonna type \\nout on a little piece of paper. It\\'s really hard.\\' \" \\nHaving problems creating a topic run for one of your topics? It could \\nbe because • Your material is story-based. After you finish telling the audience \"what \\nhappened.\" (here is nothing left to say. \\na You don\\'t have enough passion or attitude about the topic. \\n• The topic can sustain only one funny/cheesy gag. which means it\\'s prob\\xad\\nably not a real topic. \\na You\\'ve hit a creative wall. \\nGood news—if the last reason is the problem, there are ways to over\\xad\\ncome the block. Two good ones are mind mapping and list often. \\nMind Mapping Topics \\nMind mapping helps you to generate a multitude of ideas by drawing a \\nfree-form diagram of the topic. Here\\'s how it works. \\nPick a topic that you have only one or two hits on, or that you don\\'t \\nknow how to make funny. With mind mapping, it\\'s OK not to have any \\nideas when you begin. \\nWrite your topic in the middle of a page and draw a circle around it. \\nThen quickly draw other balloons containing elements of this topic until \\nIyour entire page is covered with words having to do with your topic. Then \\nlocus on each balloon and write offshoots containing the specifics of that \\ntopic. Don\\'t judge, just draw as quickly as you can. Seinfeld\\'s \"drugstore\" \\nroutine mind map might have looked something like the one on the fol\\xad\\nlowing page. \\nMind mapping a topic is a way to expand your ideas whether you are \\nwriting jokes, scripts, or essays. \\nExercise: Mind Mapping \\n\\'- Examine the \"drugstore\" mind map and come up with three jokes on \\ndrugstores that Seinfeld didn\\'t find. \\nf- Mind map a topic that\\'s already in your act. \\nJ- With your mind map in hand, do the \"Topic Rants\" exercise (page 175) \\nwhile standing in front of your comedy buddy. The mind map will prob\\xad\\nably lead you to opinions, mixes, and other aspects of your topic that you \\ncouldn\\'t come up with before. \\nToP Ten List \\n\\'t\\'other way to find more hits off a topic is to do a top ten list. This way \\n• \"u do one setup and keep adding toppers. Student Trevor Green wanted to talk about being from Oklahoma. To \\nget more ideas, he listed the top ten \"stupid things people say about peo\\xad\\nple living in Oklahoma.\" \\nThese are the jokes he ended up with on showcase night: \\nI\"People from California have the weirdest stereotypes of people from Oklahoma. \\n\" \\'Have you ever slept with a cow?\\' \\'Maybe an ugly girl or two, but I wouldn\\'t \\ncall her a cow.\\' \\n\"\\'Have you ever been abducted by a UFO?\\' \\'Yeah, how do you think I got \\nhere?\\' \\n\" \\'Have you slept with your sisters?\\' \\'No way! They\\'re lesbians!\\' \\n\" \\'Do you have homeless people in Oklahoma?\\' \\'Yeah, we call them farmers.\\'\" \\nExercise: Top Ten List \\n11 v doing a top ten list for one of your topics. Be sure to include one of \\nthe attitude words in the heading. \\nNext, add an act-out to each and every one. Cross off the losers and \\nadd at least a lew new hits to everv premise. \\nDay 21 Action Checklist \\n• mind mapped topics \\nU created jokes from a list of ten \\nLI created topic runs on at least three topics \\nCreating great material is all about rewriting, cutting, and pruning. Here \\nare four techniques\\'to assist you in sculpting your act: \\n\\' • cutting out the attitude words \\n2- callbacks \\n3- list of three \\n4. runners Cutting Out the Attitude Words \\nAt this point you should still have an attitude phrase as the lead-in to \\nevery joke. \"Do you know what\\'s weird about . . . ?\" Now that you have \\n(hopefully) developed one solid attitude for each joke, it\\'s time to cut the \\nactual attitude phrase but keep the attitude in your performance so you \\ndon\\'t sound stilted. \\nExercise: Cutting the Attitude Words \\nTake one joke and stop saying the attitude, while continuing to do the atti\\xad\\ntude. Suppose your joke starts with, \"What\\'s stupid about the elections is \\nthat all of the candidates arc lying.\" Change the opening to, \"Oh boy, \\nthese elections!\" Say it in such a way that you convey how stupid vou \\nthink the elections are. Continue the attitude of \"stupid\" throughout the \\nentire joke, using your voice, your gestures, your stance. Try this with all \\nof your jokes to see which ones work best this way. You don\\'t have to \\nactually remove the attitude phrases from all of your material, just \\nenough of them so you don\\'t sound artificial or repetitive. \\nVary how you set up your jokes. You don\\'t want your setups to be \\nrepetitive by saying the attitude word on each joke as well as repeatedly \\nsaying your topic. For instance, if your topic is \"elections,\" don\\'t open \\neach joke with, \"What\\'s stupid about these elections is . . . ,\" or, \"Another \\nthing that\\'s stupid about the election is . . .\" After you set up the topic of \\n\"elections,\" get to the specific subtopic: \"And aren\\'t the way they count \\nthe voles stupid?\" \\nInstead of depending on the words to convey your attitude, try \\nrehearsing your entire act in gibberish and see if your comedy buddy can \\ntell what the specific attitude of each joke is. Gibberish is speaking using \\nnonwords such as \"blah, blah, blah, blah.\" As you speak in gibberish, hold \\n(he attitude through the course of the jokes. If your comedy buddy can\\'t \\ntell what the attitude of a joke is, try it again really exaggerating the atti\\xad\\ntude. \\nCallbacks \\nA callback is when you call back, or mention again, something you brought \\nup earlier in the act. The great thing about callbacks is that you\\'re practi\\xad\\ncally guaranteed to get a laugh. For me, callbacks usually occur sponta\\xadneously when I\\'m performing, and then I keep them in the act. Let\\'s saw \\nfor instance, that in the beginning of my act I find out that a guy in the \\nfront row- just got a divorce and his name is Mike. Later in the show, when \\nI\\'m setting up a joke about \"guvs whose wives run off on them and they \\nend up drunk and alone,\" I add, \"like Mike here.\" Big laugh. Audiences \\nl,,ve when a comic keeps track of what is going on and can lie things \\ntogether. \\nIn this example, comic Diane Forte calls back to a joke she made at \\nthe beginning of her act, using the phrase \"Somebody\\'s in here.\" \\n[First joke] \"It\\'s weird, when you\\'re in a public rest room and someone knocks on \\nyour stall, that everyone always says the same thing, \\'Somebody\\'s in here!\\' Some\\xad\\nbody? How come we don\\'t say, \\'I\\'m in here\\'? Are we too embarrassed that some\\xad\\none\\'s going to guess who we are? \\'I\\'m in here . . . Diane Forte!\\'\" \\n[A joke five minutes later in the act] \"The weirdest thing I\\'ve ever heard about \\ncemetery plots is that in Paris, France, you can actually lease them. How\\'s that \\nwork? What happens if you don\\'t pay the rent on the first of the month? Do they \\ndig you up and knock on your coffin lid? \\'Somebody\\'s in here.\\' \" \\n—DIANE FORTE \\nExercise: Callbacks \\nLook through your material and see what you can find that you can men\\xad\\ntion early in your act and then bring back later. For instance, if you joke \\nabout how disgusting it is when your lather cleans his ears at the dinner \\ntable in the beginning of your act, you can do a callback later by saying, \\n\"So, I\\'m on a date and I\\'m cleaning out my ears and . . .\" \\nList of Three \\nthree is a magic number in comedy—there\\'s a rhythm that just naturally \\nWorks. In the list of three the comic sets up a pattern on the first two \\nMeas and then turns it on the third. \\nFor instance: \\n\"I like Florida. Everything is in the eighties: the temperature, the ages, and the \\nIQs.\" \\n—GEORGE CARLIN \"Black people should get social security at twenty-nine. Black people don\\'t live \\nthat long. Hypertension, high blood pressure . . . NYPD.\" \\n—CHRIS ROCK \\n\"Hypertension\" and \"high blood pressure\" set up a pattern and Rock \\nturns the joke on the third—\"NYPD.\" \\n1 lere Nick Griffin sets up a similar pattern: \\n\"The thing I hate about these [muscle-bound] guys is that they are predictable. \\nYou know, they\\'re big, they gotta walk around in some ripped T-shirt with some \\ntattoo skull and crossbones, barbed wire. OK, we get it. \\'You\\'re big, you\\'re mean, \\nPaddy didn\\'t hug you.\\' Whatever.\" \\n—NICK GRIFFIN \\nSee how the first two set up a pattern of expectancy and the third one \\nis the surprise. \\n\"This is exciting. A woman recently had a baby from an embryo that had been \\nfrozen for seven years. She said, \\'I had no idea if I was having a little boy, a lit\\xad\\ntle girl. . . or fish sticks. \\n—CONAN O\\'BRIEN \\nExercise: List of Three \\nPractice creating lists of three by filling in the turns of these unfinished \\nlists. \\n\"You have to break up when he (or she) ...\" \\n1. has an affair \\n2. doesn\\'t respect you \\n3. issues a restraining order (or ) \\n\"You know you\\'re not going to get that promotion when . . .\" \\n1. you lose a big customer \\n2. they take away your secretary \\n3. \\nGo through your material and make sure anytime you start a list, the \\nthird item mentioned is a laugh. See if you can add a list of three to any \\nof your jokes. Runners \\nA niinur is a catchphrase that runs through your act. It is based on your \\npersona. Your persona is your character, your voice. \\nRoseanne Barr: \"I\\'m a domestic goddess.\" \\nRodney Dangerfield: \"I don\\'t get no respect.\" \\nDennis Miller: \"I don\\'t want to get off on a rant but . . .\" \\nJoan Rivers: \"Can we talk?\" \\nI have purposely not mentioned persona until now because one of the \\nbiggest mistakes a beginning comic can make is to decide on a persona or \\na runner and then force her material to fit it. If you try to make your act \\nfit into a predetermined box you\\'ll end up limiting yourself. Instead, cre\\xad\\nate the best material you can and let your persona evolve from that. \\nPRO TALK with Woody Allen, quoted from I he Cireat Comedians, by Larry \\nWilde (1972) \\n\"There was never any sense of image. I just wrote what I thought was \\nfunny and wanted to perform it. I found after a year or two of per\\xad\\nforming that some sort of image formed itself. The critics and the peo\\xad\\nple would come away and agree on certain images they had of me . . . \\ncertain aspects. I think the worst thing I could do would be to believe \\nthe images of me I read in the newspapers. Whatever I feel is funny, I \\ndo, no matter what it is, without any regard to the subject matter, and \\nif an image emerges, fine!\" \\n\\' \\nExercise: Creating a Runner \\nGo through your act and see if there is any through line that can be \\nsummed up in a sentence. It might be an overall emotion, such as \"I\\'m \\nbitter!\" or a repeating phrase such as Judy Tenuta\\'s \"Well, it could hap\\xad\\npen!\" If you can\\'t come up with a runner right now, that is normal. Some\\xad\\ntimes it takes years to find. Day 22 Action Checklist \\nU cut out saying the attitude phrase before some jokes \\n• practiced my jokes in gibberish \\nJ looked to see if you can add a callback to your act \\n.3 created a list of three \\n-I created a runner (or at least gave it serious thought) \\nGather up all your index cards that list your topics—both authentic and \\ncurrent events—and run your entire act for yotir comedy buddy. You will \\nboth be able to feel which jokes are clunkers. They are the bits that are: \\n• confusing \\n• obscure \\n• out of date \\n• long \\n• hack \\nTear up the index cards with the clunkers and throw them away. What \\nis left is your act. It will be up to an audience of strangers, however, to \\ndecide what actually works. The good news: you probably have at least \\nthree minutes of current-event jokes, plus even more material that is based \\non your personal issues. The bad news: in today\\'s constantly changing \\nsocial and political climate, current-event jokes become real old real last. \\nDon\\'t be surprised if the current-event joke that got a big laugh on Mon\\xad\\nday gets no reaction by Friday. \\nBecause the world changes so quickly, beginning comics should limit \\ncurrent-event jokes to no more than 20 percent of their act. Writers also \\ndon\\'t want to submit sample jokes that are dated. At the time of this writ\\xad\\ning what\\'s going on is: \\nBush is elected president in contested election. \\nHoliday depression hits hard. \\nViagra is the best-selling drug. \\nTeenagers are piercing a variety of body parts. \\nThe Utility industry is deregulating. \\nOne-year-olds are taking 1Q tests. \\nSony PlayStation 2 is sold out. Notice how old these topics seem. Sometimes you can stockpile cer\\xad\\ntain types of current-events jokes. For instance, you might have a holiday \\nchunk you can use every December. However, most current-event topics \\nhave a very short shelf life, which is another reason why every comic and \\ncomedv writer has to learn to create jokes on a moments notice. Even if \\nyou are a prolific joke writer, if you do only current-event jokes you\\'ll end \\nup competing with all the pros on TV. By the time the audience sccsjwi/-\\ncurrent-evenl joke, they will have probably already heard it. That\\'s why \\nit\\'s important to have the bulk of your act rooted in those authentic top\\xad\\nics that can last for years: \"childhood,\" \"puberty,\" \"parents,\" and so on. \\nExercise: Honing Your Act \\nGo through all of your index cards. \\n1. On each card, circle one topic. (You should circle only one topic and one \\njoke per card.) \\n2. Make sure the topic is relatable. \\n3. Write an attitude word on each card. (You don\\'t have to say it, but you \\nmust act it.) \\n4. Is that attitude expressed by any of the following words: stupid, tveirtl, \\nhard, bugs me, scary? \\n5. Does each topic have a premise that is written out? \\n6. Does that premise answer the attitude-topic question? (\"Do you know \\nwhat\\'s weird?\") \\n7. Do most topics lead to an act-out? \\nH. Docs the act-out have the same cast of characters as the setup? \\n9. Does the aci-oul exaggerate the attitude? \\n10. After some act-outs, do you have a mix? \\n11. Do you follow the mix with another act-out? \\n12. Do you have a lot of hits on most topics (topic run)? \\n13. If you have a list of three items, is the third one a turn? \\nDay 23 Action Checklist \\n-I You\\'ve tossed the clunkers. \\nQ You\\'ve gone through the keepers to make sure that they meet all the good \\njoke requirements. Working New Material into Your Act \\nPRO TALK with Phyllis Oilier \\n\"Placement of jokes in your set list is very crucial. 1 put new jokes in a \\nline at a time or a bit at a time, someplace I think it would be OK. I have \\ntaken a line out from a place it has been for five years because it wasn t \\ngetting the laugh that 1 thought it should. 1 play with my material, but \\nonce you get it set it\\'s like Mozart—you don\\'t even change a rest.\" \\nSandwich the new material between material that you know is solid. \\nThis is the best way to find out if your new stuff works. If the old joke \\ngets its usual laugh and the new joke that follows it bombs, you\\'ll know \\nthe problem was the joke and not the audience. The old joke after the \\nnew one will rescue you, get the audience back on track if the new joke \\nfalls Hat. \\nPRO TALK with Greg Proofs \\n\"Stand-up is like jazz—you\\'re not going to do the same material every \\nday but you\\'re going to weave in and out of the scene. You can make it \\nsound just like the album or you can take off.\" For your second performance you will be adding no more than two min\\xad\\nutes of current-event material and repeating the reworked material based \\non your life. \\nRepeating Old Material \\nStand-up is about constantly reworking material until it falls into the \\n\"just right\" groove. Once material lands in that perfect groove, stop fuss\\xad\\ning with it. Sometimes changing one word in a joke is the difference \\nbetween hearing laughs and hearing a pin drop. So if a joke ain\\'t broke, \\ndon\\'t fix it. \\nThe challenge for all comics is making old material sound fresh—like \\nwe just thought of it that moment. Material becomes stale when the \\ncomic is no longer in toucb with the emotions (attitude) that drove the \\njoke initially to a laugh. Have you ever told a funny story at a party and \\ngot a laugh and then told the same story again to utter silence? The first \\ntime people tell a story, they picture it as they tell it, putting themselves \\ninside the story. The second time they tell a funny story, they usually go \\nfor the laughs, the reaction to the story, and this puts them outside the \\nstory. When this happens with stand-up material, there are only two \\nthings to do: \\nCut it. \\nor \\nGet back into it. \\nExercise: Picturing It \\nTo get the spontaneity back into your material, picture what you arc talk\\xad\\ning about and feel the attitude as if the event just happened and this is \\nthe first lime you\\'re mentioning it. Exercise: Sandwiching In New Material \\nCreate a set list with your new material in between jokes that you feel \\nconfident about. \\nTiming \\nOne of the most important aspects of performing comedy is timing. \\nUnfortunately, it\\'s not something you can learn from a book, try to do \\nright, or even think about. In fact, if vou arc thinking about your timing, \\nyou can be sure it\\'s off. Ever try to dance with someone who is counting \\nout loud? Enough said. \\nAttitude creates timing. If you are really into the attitude of each \\njoke, then you don\\'t have to worry about timing. Here is a tip that can \\nalso help keep you from stepping on the toes of your jokes: Don\\'t talk while \\nthe audience is laughing. \\nSiand-up is not a monologue—it\\'s a dialogue with the audience. You \\ntalk, then the audience talks (by laughing, hopefully), and then you \\nrespond to the audience. You wouldn\\'t talk while someone also was \\nspeaking during a conversation, so shut up after each joke to give the \\naudience time to laugh—or otherwise they might not. \\nEND JOKE \\ncurve = laughs \\nLook at the laugh graph above. When you end a joke, it takes a few \\nseconds for the audience to laugh, which sometimes seems like an eter\\xad\\nnity. Amateur comics will start their next joke at A, cutting off the laughs. \\nA pro will put off starting the next joke until B, letting the audience \\nlaugh. \\n. Exercise: Holding for the Laughs \\nIVi-form your act for your comedy buddy and practice sustaining the atti\\xad\\ntude and holding for the laughs. \\nTime your acts and limit yourself to do no more than five minutes for \\nthis performance. \\n\"What do I do while I\\'m letting the audience laugh? Just stand \\nthere?\" \\nAdding Tags \\nYou never \"just stand there\"—always convey an attitude. So while the \\naudience laughs, you add a tag to the joke by repeating the attitude. For \\ninstance, if the joke starts off, \"It\\'s weird . . . ,\" at the end of the joke, tag \\nit by repeating, \"It\\'s weird.\" This tag can be said quickly, as if to yourself \\nin you can shout it. It can even be unspoken, perhaps shown by a shaking \\nof vour head. But one thing the tag should never be is absent. There \\nshould never be even one moment when you are onstage and attitude-\\nfree. It\\'s the kiss of death because audiences respond to emotions, not \\nwords. \\n\"Wliat about talking to the audience? Asking them, \\'Where are you \\nfrom? How are you all doing?\\' \" \\nTalking to the Audience \\n\\'n the old days comics didn\\'t talk to the audience because it took away \\nfrom their act. But these days, with TV talk shows, live chat on the Inter\\xad\\nnet, and everyone out for their fifteen minutes of fame, there is less of a \\ndivision between the show and the audience. Now, comics need to know \\nnot just how to talk to the audience but also how to respond to what they \\nSay with humor. Since you are only doing five-minute sets at the moment, \\n•-\\'lis isn\\'t really a big concern for you yet. But as your career grows ii will \\n°1\\' <> challenge you\\'ll face. Even TV writers need to hone this skill because \\nProducers can often sound like hecklers. And if you can handle hecklers \\nas a stand-up comic, it will make all future hostile situations easier. Here \\nare some tips from veteran Texas comic Dean Lewis. • The majority of hecklers are men. Women tend to be hecklers only when \\ndrunk. Men usually heckle because they want to challenge you and gain \\ncontrol. Drunk women heckle because they want attention. If either gets \\nwhat they want (control or attention), they will keep coming back for \\nmore. Do not give it to ihem. \\n• Men heckle if they sense weakness. Take control of the stage as soon as \\npossible. Do this by having good microphone technique, having strong \\nmaterial, making eye contact with audience members, being energetic, \\nand getting onstage quickly. Avoid looking meek. \\n• The way you give the audience opportunities to heckle is by taking too \\nlong to get to the funny. The sooner you get laughs onstage, the less likely \\nvou are to get heckled. \\n• If you get heckled, alwavs ignore it at first. The heckler just wants to get \\nsome attention. If vou stop your show and slam the heckler, he got what \\nhe wanted. In other words, he won. It is better to ignore the heckler \\nbecause this prevents him from getting what he wants. \\n• If the heckler is with somebody, ask her or him to make the jerk shut up. \\nThe heckler may be trying to impress their date and if you make their \\ndate feel uncomfortable, then the heckler will probably not want to con\\xad\\ntinue with the situation. \\n• If a heckler persists in challenging you, try getting the audience to shut \\nthem up for you. Ask the audience if this person is bothering them. They \\nwill usually respond with a loud \"Yes!\" Or applause. Usually this will \\nembarrass or appease the heckler so he will shut up. \\n• Never hit a heckler harder than they hit you. For example, if the heckler \\nmakes a comment about your hair, and you respond by slamming the \\nheckler\\'s mother, you may shut them up but you will very likely lose the \\naudience. You cannot come back too hard or you will appear to be a bully. \\nIf thev heckle your hair, come back with something about their hair. If \\nthey slam your shirt, you can then say something about the way he is \\ndressed. \\n• Try to distinguish between a heckler and somebody who is verbal and \\njust having a good time. Some people will respond to your material by \\nlaughing and talking back to you. They will say things like, \"I heard \\nthat,\" or, \"I know that\\'s right!\" and so on. These are not heckles! This is \\nthe way this person responds. Stopping your show to deal with this type \\nof interruption is a mistake. The verbal audience member doesn\\'t realise \\nhe is a pest. If you make a big deal out of it, two things will most likely \\nhappen: (1) The verbal person will hate you for making them feel foolish-\\n(2) The audience probably doesn\\'t know that this person is bothering you, so if you stop your set to pick on this one person, the audience can \\nturn on you. They didn\\'t see a problem, so it appears as if you are just a \\njerk comic picking on a helpless audience member. \\nB It is almost always best to phrase a comeback to a heckler in the form of \\na question. The reason for this is twofold: \\n1. Asking someone a question causes him to stop and think of an \\nanswer. This breaks any rhythm he may have. This pause gives \\nyou a chance to slam them with another comeback, make fun of \\nhow slow he is responding, or answer the question for him in a \\nfunny way In other words, you\\'ve taken control of the situation. \\n2. Phrasing the comeback so it has to be answered makes the situa\\xad\\ntion no win for him. No matter how he responds, he will sound \\nfoolish. Once again, this gives you more control in this situation. \\nHere is an example. A comeback to a heckle might be, \"You, sir, are \\nthe reason why brothers and sisters shouldn\\'t marry!\" Very funny, \\nbut the problem is that the heckler can now slam you. Here is a \\nbetter way to use the comeback in the form of a rhetorical ques\\xad\\ntion: \"Sir, does it bother you knowing that you are the result of \\nyour father marrying his sister?\" No matter what response he has. \\nhe will now sound stupid. If he says, \"No,\" you can make fun of \\nthat. If he says, \"Yes,\" then he has admitted that he is an interbred \\nfreak, and you can make fun of that. Either way, the heckler will \\nrealize that he is in a no-win situation and shut up. \\n• It vou want to dialogue with the audience as a way of involving them \\nmore in your set by asking the audience a question, make it a simple rhe\\xad\\ntorical \"yes\" or \"no\" question. It is fun for the audience to get involved in \\nyour act, but this does it in a way that doesn\\'t encourage them to yell out \\nlong answers. For instance . . . \\nWrong way: \\n[Talking to man in the audience] \"What did you think of the Super Bowl?\" \\nThis puts someone on the spot—he has to instantly come up with an \\nOpinion. It\\'s also risky, because he might say something that\\'s funnier \\nthan your next line. \\nRight way: \\n\"Anybody watch the Super Bowir \\nThis involves the audience without putting anyone on the spot and \\ne\\'icits a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. • If something happens in the room, respond to it. Saying anything imme\\xad\\ndiately is more important than thinking for a few seconds and then say\\xad\\ning something \"funny.\" Respond to a disruption ASAP! This helps keep \\nthe audience focused on the show and not ihc disruption. You don\\'t warn \\nto be a joke machine who just gets up and delivers material. You should \\ncomment when a waitress drops a tray of drinks, or five people get up \\nand leave, or someone asks you a question. If you say, \"I\\'m going to col\\xad\\nlege,\" and someone asks, \"What college?\" you have to answer. \\n• When a mishap occurs, such as the mike stand breaks, the lights go out, \\nor there is a puff of smoke from the grassy knoll, acknowledge it. When \\nyou call the situation, it puts the audience at ease. They see that you\\'re \\nnot thrown by what happened, and they don\\'t have to feel sorry or \\nembarrassed for vou. Make a joke about it and move on. \\n• If it\\'s a small crowd, less than fifty people, talk to them because they\\'ll \\ntend to laugh more in their heads than out loud. That\\'s especially true if \\nthey are spread out in a room. Invoking the audience in a conversation \\nreminds them that they aren\\'t watching TV—you can hear them, and it\\'s \\nappropriate to laugh out loud. \\n• Talk to the audience in small increments rather than large chunks—oth\\xad\\nerwise it will seem like filler. \\n• Audience members can feel very uncomfortable when the comic talks to \\nthem. Most people in an audience do not want to be the center of atten\\xad\\ntion. Therefore, trv not to talk to one person immediately. Talk to the \\naudience as a group, then maybe address a row, and then a table, and \\nfinally one person. This way you have slowly gained their trust as you \\nworked your way down to one person. \\nThere are certain occasions when you shouldn\\'t talk to the audience: \\n• When your performance is also an audition. A producer wants to know \\nthat he can buy the act he is seeing. Even if your improv with the audi\\xad\\nence was really funny, it\\'s something that can\\'t be recreated. \\n• When a club manager tells you not to talk to them—don\\'t. \\n• When you\\'re doing only a five-minute set. And while we\\'re on the sub\\xad\\nject: don\\'t waste your time doing improv with the audience. The audi\\xad\\nence will sense that you\\'re using them as filler and resent having to pay \\n$10 for a beer ami write your act. They don\\'t mind being a part of the \\nshow, but they don\\'t want to be the whole show. \\n• Don\\'t start every setup with a question like \"Anybody here on a date?\" U \\ngets redundant really fast. Space your questions out throughout your act. and ask them only if you have a good reason for doing so. In other words, \\nyou have a punch line for their response. \\nThe biggest key to talking to the audience is listening to them. Relax, \\nbreathe, and listen. Remember, the audience is more scared to talk to you \\nthan you are to talk to them. \\nKeeping Your Energy Up and Out \\nEnergy drives an act. Without energy there is no performance. The way \\nthat energy expresses itself can be anything, from the quiet concen\\xad\\ntration of Steven Wright to the intense ranting of Dennis Miller, but it \\nhas to be there in everything you do and say for every moment you\\'re \\nonstage. \\nBefore I go on, 1 always feel a surge of energy inside me. Call it \\nnerves, excitement, or incontinence—I\\'m bursting with it. It\\'s not very \\ncomfortable, which is why some comics try to escape it with drugs or \\nalcohol. Big mistake, because both of them will screw up the liming and \\nconnection to the audience. Being sober onstage enables me to be in con\\xad\\ntrol of my energy releases. When I set up my joke, I pull in the reins on \\nmv horses. During the act-out, I let them gallop at full speed. After the \\nlaughs I pull them back in again to set up the next joke. After a while \\nyou\\'ll probably get a feel for this too and be able to pull in your energy \\nand then release it again. Don\\'t drink or do drugs to smooth out your \\nnerves. Ride the wild horse and just stay out ol your own way. \\nExercise: Sustaining Energy \\nPerform your act for your comedy buddy so that she can make sure your \\nenergy level is controlled during the setups and up and out for the act-\\nouts. \\nDay 24 Action Checklist \\n-J reconnected yourself to your authentic material \\nQ worked current-event material into your act \\nQ practiced holding for the laughs \\nQ carried the attitude of the joke into a tag \\n£l had comedy buddy check to make sure you kept energy up in your act \\nW timed your act and cut it to five minutes or less \\\\ doing niche material that works only for a certain kind of audience. Later \\nin this book I will show you how to market your act. But the general rule \\nis—if the joke doesn\\'t get laughs, it isn\\'t funny. \\nPRO TAIK with comic Andy Kindler \\n|To the audience| \"1 know you think I\\'m having a bad set. I\\'m not, \\nyou\\'re having a bad set. Go home, read a book, study, and in ten years \\nyou will be laughing at this stuff.\" \\n\"My act went really well. Ant I ready for the big time?\" \\nMore than any other creative field, stand-up comedy lets you know \\nexactly how you arc doing. The audience tells you instantly. When you \\ncan make an audience laugh constantly for one hour, you\\'ll be making the \\nbig bucks. \\nUntil the checks with lots of zeros start pouring in, here\\'s a way to \\nput your performance in perspective. \\nLPM (Laughs per Minute) Formula \\n(Courtesy of Davey DiGeorgio, staff writer on Laic Show with David Let-\\ntcrnian and former student.) \\nListen to the tape of your set and give yourself points at the end of each \\njoke according to this formula: \\nLOUD laughter and EVERYONE applauds = 5 points \\nLOUD laughter and a SMATTERING of applause = 4 points \\nLOUD laughter from EVERYONE and NO applause = 3 points \\nMEDIUM laughs = 2 points \\nSMATTERING of laughs = 1 point \\n\\' Add up your total laughter points. \\n2- How many minutes were you onstage? \\n3. Divide line 1 by line 2 and enter your LPM here. \\n12 to 20: You are rockin\\', baby, and if you aren\\'t making the big \\nbucks yet—you will. 9 to 12: You\\'re doing well and are ready to get paid, but think about \\nshortening your setups. \\n6 to 9: Nol bad, but not ready for the big time. \\nBelow 6: Something ain\\'t working. Use (he guidelines on page 167, \\n\"Reworking Your Act,\" to get better. \\nCongratulations, you\\'ve completed the joke writing/stand-up course. \\nIf you really loved being onstage, you might want to consider a career as \\na stand-up comic. If performing is not your thing but writing is, there are \\nmany opportunities for comedy writers. Whether you are a writer or a \\nperformer or both, you need material, and a lot of it. The next section \\nprovides exercises on creating more material on a daily basis. \\n\\\\ \\nBeing a comedy writer or a stand-up comic is not a nine-to-five job. It \\nmeans spending twenty-four hours seven days a week looking for the \\nfunny, writing the funny, and performing the funny. You are constantly \\ndocumenting your perception of the world through your unique filter. \\nThis filter transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary—or at least \\ninto the funny. Civilians (what I call everyone not in the creative busi\\xad\\nness) might be annoyed by a rude salesman, but the comic thinks, \"How \\ncan I use this?\" Life becomes a nonstop hunt for material. When civilians \\nmeet a strange character, they might think, \"Weirdo. I\\'m getting out of \\nhere!\" But we creative types enjoy engaging with the peculiar types \\nbecause they can be rich fodder for material—an amusing character to act \\nout in a joke or write into a sitcom. If you are serious about comedy, your \\n\\\\\\\\hole life revolves around getting material. A comic can never have enough material. Professional comics and com\\xad\\nedy writers usually have a stockpile of two hours of good material. Work\\xad\\ning comics carry a Rolodex of jokes in their heads that has material right \\nfor any audience. College students—no problem. Senior citizens—no \\nproblem. Convicted felons—well, problem. \\nWc all get stuck. The following exercises can inspire you and help \\nkeep new material flowing. Some might work better for you than others. \\nGet in the habit of doing at least one exercise every day \\nPRO TALK with Chris Titus \\nWhat does this stand-up comic and star of his own sitcom, Titus, do \\nwhen he is stuck? \"1 sit down and write crap for forty minutes. Every\\xad\\nbody thinks that they have to write funny, every line. All you have to \\ndo is pick a suhject and write about that and then pick another subject \\nand write about that. I guarantee you that at the end of forty minutes, \\nyou will crank out a funny line because it lakes forty minutes for your \\nbrain to click over from the dealing-with-life side to the creative side. \\nThen go back to what you wrote and fix it. And the more writing ses\\xad\\nsions you have, the quicker your creativity will click in.\" \\nExercise 1: Using the Internet \\nOne ol the biggest misconceptions about writing comedy is that you start \\nby coming up with funny ideas. If I had to wait for something funny to \\nstrike me before I wrote, I wouldn\\'t be writing much material but I would \\nbe taking a lot more drugs. The \"funny first\" approach to creativity can be \\nstifling and depressing when nothing seems funny. A more productive \\napproach is starting with an unfunny topic and making it funny. And if \\nyou\\'re having a hard time finding new topics, the Internet can steer you to \\nthe hot topics that are on everyone\\'s mind. News sites and chat rooms are \\na good source for new topics, and search engines will help you leant more \\nabout them. When I worked for the National Potato Council (no joke), I did a search on potatoes and found out tons of information on topics like \\ncross-hybridization, crop rotation, and potato diseases. \"What\\'s up with \\nblight?\" \\nFind three unfunny topics on the Internet that you don\\'t cover in \\nsour act. Spend an hour researching them and come up with one good \\nnew joke. Starting today, if you come up with just one great new joke \\neverv day, you\\'ll have an hour and a half of great material in a year. \\nExercise 2: 60 to a Newsstand \\nIf you can\\'t squeeze out any more jokes about that dysfunctional family \\nof vours, gel out of the house and hang out at a newsstand—it\\'s a Mecca \\nfor premise seekers. Magazines entice you to buy them by putting catchy \\nheadlines on the cover. Comics need catchy setups to entice the audience \\nto listen, and writers need to keep topical. The headlines on a Cosmopoli\\xad\\ntan cover are often the perfect setup for material chunks. (\"Ten ways to \\nattract a man.\" \"How do you know when you need a therapisi?\" \"Ways \\nto break up a relationship.\" \"What\\'s hot in music today?\") Magazines \\nspend millions on market research in order to be hot, hip, and happen\\xad\\ning—why not benefit from what they\\'ve learned, for free? \\nMine for comedy material by using the magazine headlines as a \\npremise for a list often, a mind map, or a rant. \\nExercise 3: Turn Stories into Comedy Topics \\nReady to take a walk on the wild side? This exercise is potentially very \\ndangerous—don\\'t do it unless you promise to follow the directions to a \\ntee. If I\\'ve said it once, I\\'ve said it a million times, stories are the kiss of \\ndeath to joke writers. However, it is possible to turn these bombs to blow-\\naway comedy. \\nFirst, in your idea book wrile out a funny story about something that \\nhappened to you. \\nThen circle any one- or two-worded topics and list them here: Now gjve these topics an attitude and see where the emotion takes \\nyou. Forget the story reality, \"what really happened\" and so on. Instead \\nlet the attitude take you someplace you\\'ve never been before. Let yourself \\nbe surprised. \\nPRO TAIK with comic Kutliy Griffin \\n\"When writing material I look to what happened to me that week. I\\'m \\nin heaven if there is some horrible movie of the week on or if I had a crazy \\nrun-in with a celebrity. Or if some guy just dumped me—I\\'m golden. \\nWhat\\'s funny is anything tragic. We just had our Griffen family Easter \\nand it was just a disaster where my sister-in-law got drunk and everything \\ngot hideous and ugly, and I thought—this could be good funny.\" \\nAnother way to turn a story into comedy material is to write out a \\nstory and create a joke every four or five lines. Continue the same joke \\nwriting throughout the entire story. \\nExercise 4: Talking on the Phone with Friends \\nWhen talking on the phone with friends, write down anything you (or \\nthey) say that gets a laugh. Write down all topics that you talked about \\nand do attitude runs on them. \\nExercise 5: Comedy from Characters \\nPRO TAIK with George Wallace \\n\"Most people write my material. People will come up to me and sax-\\nsomething stupid. 1 was at the airport waiting for my luggage and a \\nlady comes up to me and says, \\'Mr. Wallace, mighty quiet today\\' And \\nI\\'m thinking, \\'Well hell, I\\'m standing here by myself. Who\\'d I be talk\\xad\\ning to?\\' \" \\nSpend the day noticing the people who cross your path. Make a list \\nof these characters and find places in your act where you can act them put. Many limes comics create jokes backwards—they Start with the act-\\nout and then find the setup. \\nRichard Jeni transformed an act-out of an NFL referee into a killer \\nroutine that he performed on I he Tonight Show with Jay Law. lie started \\nwith a premise. \\n\"Referees slop the entire game so the referee can click a button on his belt, acti\\xad\\nvate a giant sound system, and point the guy out in front of the whole country and \\nhumiliate him. It\\'s so unnecessary, [acf-ouf] \\'Pssht. [he clicks his belt] The rea\\xad\\nson we stopped, the reason we\\'re all hanging around out here not doing anything \\nright now is because some people don\\'t seem to know the rules. Isn\\'t that right \\nnumber [pointing] seventy-one? Seventy-one, I can\\'t even look at you.\\'\" \\nThen Jeni found another premise. \\n\"It\\'s a human thing to want to be heard, [he then acts out a mix of a sixty-two-\\nyear-old guy who just wants to talk] \\'Uh, there was no penalty. This has nothing to \\ndo with the game, the players, or the National Football League. I need to talk. I \\ncan\\'t keep this up anymore. I feel like an idiot out here. I mean, sure I\\'m the ref, \\nbut who am I to judge these players? I mean, look at some of the choices I\\'ve made \\nin my own life. I\\'m sixty-two years old and I\\'m a freaking referee. I\\'ll be honest \\nwith you.\\'\" \\nJeni sal down on the stage and continued this act-out/mix of the \\nreferee. \\n\" \\'My wife is getting fat as a house. I\\'m telling you ... I don\\'t know ... I love \\nmy kids but if I had to do it again. . . Ooh, I\\'d wear a condom.\\'\" \\nFie took the act-oul/mix even further. \\n\" \\'You know what\\'s really bothering me? I just kind of feel like I\\'m a woman \\ntrapped in a man\\'s body. Do you ever dress up in your wife\\'s panties when nobody\\'s \\nhome? Give me a pair of panties and some perfume, I am one happy ref. The hell \\nwith football. I feel a lot better now. We better get back to the game, [he stood \\nup] First down!\\'\" \\nWriters especially will find that keeping a journal of characters will \\ncome in handy when writing not only jokes but comedy scripts. Exercise 6: Stream of Consciousness Writing \\nIn the morning, spend ten minutes writing stream of consciousness— \\nwhatever comes into your head—ignoring all rules of grammar, spelling, \\nand even logic. It could look something like this: \\nWoke up with a dream of dead goldfish and looked outside and it was \\nanother cloudy day. Dark, dark. My vegetable garden is a mess. I forgot \\nwhen I planted seeds that something would grow—yeah, weeds. Oh, I\\'ve \\ngot 10 pick up my photos at one-hour photo which have been there for a \\nweek. Boy am I hungry. Breakfast and then there\\'s lunch. That\\'s what I \\nwant. But I have to get out of bed. A maid would be nice . . . \\nThese stream of consciousness ramblings are the raw material of your \\nunconscious mind, and there arc probably some authentic topics in there \\nthat haven\\'t surfaced yet. Circle any words that can be topics, maybe \\neven freely associate to them, and then run them through the joke devel\\xad\\nopment process. For example, for the above list topics could be \\n• death \\n• goldfish as pets \\n• breakfast \\n• lunch \\n• maids \\n• vegetable gardens \\n• one-hour photo \\nA joke might come out of these topics: \\n\"In LA. relationships don\\'t last. You go on vacation and break up by the time you \\ncome home. Thank God for one-hour photo, so you can see your vacation photos \\nwhile you\\'re still in the relationship. \\'Honey, look how happy we are . . . [looking \\naround] Honey?\\'\" \\n\"I don\\'t understand why people say, \\'I want to kill myself, I have nothing to look \\nforward to.\\' How can anyone not have anything to look forward to when there is \\nlunch!\" Exercise 7: Mixes \\nWrite ten \"what if\\'s.\" For example, \"What if dogs had thumbs? They \\ncould open the door for themselves. They could hitchhike instead of \\nwalk. They could give movie reviews—\\'Gone With the Wind. Good story, \\nbut not enough dogs. Thumbs down!\\' \" (Don\\'t steal that. Write your \\nown.) \\nExercise 8: Writing Opinions on Current Events \\nWrite a list of the headlines off the Internet news sites or today\\'s news\\xad\\npaper. Pick at least two current-event topics and write ten opinions about \\neach of them. \\nExercise 9: Rants and Raves \\nTape-record yourself ranting out loud for ten minutes about one topic. \\nDo not stop talking. Keep the energy up and the attitudes flying- Listen \\nto the tape and write down any material that might have emerged. \\nExercise 10: Comedy Buddy Exchange \\nExchange topics with your comedy buddy and write jokes for each other. \\nExercise 11: Characters \\nMake a list of the people who have had a big impact on your life. These \\nshould be people you actually know. (Don\\'t put down the pope unless the \\ntwo of you had some funny chats while you chauffeured the Popcmobile.) \\nThis list could include husband, first love, ex-wife, Weight Watchers \\nmeeting coach, cell mate, current lesbian lover, and so on. Pretend to be \\nthem. Have your comedy buddv interview you as that character. Put \\nthese characters in different situations and find their opinions on differ\\xad\\nent topics. See what material these characters generate and work back-\\nWards from vour act-outs to find premises and setups. \\nExercise 12: Detailing an Event \\nWrite out the details of the first two hours of your day. Include the most \\n•inute details. \"Wrong way: \\nWoke up, ate breakfast, and went to the beach. \\nRight way: \\nWoke up with my dog licking my face, wanting to be fed. I went to the \\nbathroom, washed my hands, and went into the kitchen to face all the \\nleftover dishes from last night. My dog licked the dishes as I put them \\ninio the dishwasher. \\nUnderline every topic and, next to each, write other things about that \\ntopic. For example: \\nDogs—I let my dogs lick my dishes, but when people are over I pretend to \\nbe shocked. \"They\\'ve never done this before. This is disgusting!\" \\n/ washed my hands—Does everyone really wash their hands after they use \\nthe bathroom? Or do we just do it when other people are watching? \\nWhat else do we do or not do when other people are watching? \\nExercise 13: Buddy Up \\nWrite twenty topics on separate pieces of paper. You can get these topics \\nfrom the Internet, magazines, newspapers, TV, whatever. Then as quickly \\nas possible, pick one out of a bag and put a \"What\\'s up with\" in front of \\nit and riff on it until you come up with an opinion. Then have your com\\xad\\nedy buddy come up with an opinion on it. Then you come up with \\nanother opinion on it. Keep going until each of you has come up with \\nthree opinions on each topic. \\nExercise 14: Stepping-Stones of Life \\nMake a list of the major stepping-stones of your life, keeping the descrip\\xad\\ntions brief. For instance: puberty, going to college, getting married, your first \\nbra, your first walker. \\nTake a stepping-stone and mind map it. For instance, if the stepping-\\nstone was college, then your circles might include leaving home, parents \\nbeing alone, dorm rooms, roommates, drinking, livingfor thefirst time without par\\xad\\nents, early morning classes, cafeteria food, studying, drinking, and more drinking. \\nThis is a very powerful exercise. Mind map a different stepping-stone \\nevery day until you\\'ve clone them all. Need more exercises? Go to iviviv.enmedyworkslwpS.com for new writing \\nexercises. \\nStudy and restudy the rules of comedy until they are second nature. \\nThen cut loose and ride your talent. Technique can carry you only so far. \\nPassion and soul have to take you the rest of the way. c|Ppinducers, development people, and network executives are scouring \\n•JET small theaters in search of the next break-out talent, so one-person \\nshows have become a great way to be discovered. These shows are similar \\nto a play, but all the parts are played by one person. One-person shows can \\nbe a collection of character vignettes, but usually they are fully developed, \\nhighly personal stories. A one-person show doesn\\'t have to be humorous, \\nalthough most of them are. Actually, the subject matter is often serious, \\nbut the story is often told in a funny way Rather than reducing the emo\\xad\\ntional impact of the story, the humor in a good one-person show actually \\nheightens it—sometimes to the point where the audience is actually laugh\\xad\\ning through their tears. These shows are generally written and performed \\nby the comic but produced and directed by someone else. \\nPRO TALK with Judl Brown, talent coordinator for the U.S. Comedy Arts \\nFestival (Aspen) \\n\"We collect a number of one-person shows, and the performers range \\nfrom newcomers to established actors. We look at the shows from a \\ndevelopment standpoint. Do they tell a story and is it a story that we \\ncan develop into a show?\" One-person shows were the path to success lor such powerhouse \\ncomic actors as: \\n• Lily Tomlin \\nH Whoopi Goldberg \\n• Chazz Palminteri \\n• Spaulding Gray \\n• Chris Titus \\n• Pee-wee I lerman (Paul Reubens) \\n• Julia Sweenev (the androgynous character Pat on Saturday Night live) \\nm Rick Reynolds \\nWhat is the difference between stand-up and one-person shows? \\nWhen doing a one-person show . . . \\n• You don\\'t have to make the audience laugh the whole time. \\n• You tell a dramatic story, using humor. \\n• The show is at least an hour with no opening act. \\n• You don\\'t have to include the audience in your show. \\n• You usually act out a number of characters. \\n• Your audience is usually sober, but not necessarily—many comedy clubs \\npresent one-person shows. \\nPRO TALK with Mark Travis, director of the one-person show A Bronx Tale, \\nDana Gould\\'s Insomnia, and many TV shows \\n\"Stand-up consists of disconnected pieces or jokes. As a matter of fact, \\nsometimes the more disconnected the jokes are from each other, the \\nfunnier the comic is. A one-person show has a story line. While a \\nstand-up comic focuses on getting an immediate reaction from the \\naudience after every joke, a person doing a solo show takes the audi\\xad\\nence on a journey\" \\nWhen you perform at a club, you\\'re obligated to fulfill the expecta\\xad\\ntions of the owner, which is to make the audience laugh a lot. This means \\nftat any piece that goes longer than fifteen seconds without getting a \\nlaugh is thrown out. Any piece that is emotionally moving gets tossed \\ntoo. Comedv club owners don\\'t like it when their customers cry. Most audiences don\\'t want to feel touched either—that\\'s not why they came \\nihere. But if you shine at storytelling or doing characters, you might want \\nto consider doing a one-person show in a theater. \\n\"How do I know if I should put together a one-person show?\" \\nI Examine your motivation for doing it. \\nGood reason—I want to express myself and connect with others. \\nBad reason—I want to get discovered and get my own TV show. \\nOf course, most performers would love to be famous stars with a \\nJacuzzi in their dressing rooms and personal masseuses on stalf. I lowever, \\nif career advancement is your sole motivation lor creating a one-person \\nshow, your cousin Harold, the one who ties cherries with his tongue, has \\na better chance of hitting the big time than you do. At least that is enter\\xad\\ntainment. Ego productions are a bore. \\nThere is only one reason to do a one-person show—you have a burn\\xad\\ning desire to tell a particular story. And that story can be anything from a \\nrepertoire of different characters to a story that brings tears to people\\'s \\neyes. In fact, most one-person shows are based on quite significant and \\nserious themes. \\nJulia Sweeney\\'s And God Said, \"Ha!\" was a comedy based on the true \\nstory of both her brother and herself getting cancer at the same time, and \\nher whole family moving into her two-bedroom apartment. Her show \\nsold out in L.A., went on to a Broadway run, was published as a book, \\nwas released as a movie by Miramax, and was rereleased as a rental video. \\nRich Shydner\\'s one-man show True Love Confessions was the story of \\nhis marriage and included insightful observations about relationships. \\n\"I think being in love means that 90 percent of the time you look at the other per\\xad\\nson and think to yourself, \\'I want to spend the rest of my life with you,\\' But 10 \\npercent of the time you may think, \\'How can I fake my death?\\'\" \\nPRO TALK with Rich Shydner \\n\"The show is much more personal than my act was. In stand-up, every \\nother word is you, and everybody relates to your act based on how good \\nyour iw< is. With this [one-person show], I get down to the essentials \\nand tell my story.\" Claudia Shear\\'s one-person show Blown Sideways Through Life, re\\xad\\ncounted sixty-four of her temporary jobs. Her sold-out off-Broadway run \\nwon the prestigious Obie and was job number sixty-five. \\nWhoopi Goldberg did a one-person show that included a repertoire \\n,,l seventeen characters, including a blit7.ed-out junkie and a brainless \\nVallev girl. It look her from the Comedy Store in Hollywood to Broadway \\nu, starring in movies. \\nPRO TALK with Whoopi Goldberg \\n\"] did my [one-person] show because I wanted to make people laugh \\nand think.\" \\nIn Rick Reynolds\\'s one-person show Only the Truth Is Funny, he starts \\nout by saying, \"I won\\'t lie to you once tonight, not once.\" Reynolds \\nfound his highly successful one-person show from \"throwing out all my \\ncomedy routines and writing the truth.\" His show is about his family \\nfrom hell—a manic-depressive mom who brought home a succession of \\nmen with whom she had screaming fights; a stepfather who whacked the \\nback of Rick\\'s hand with a steak knife during dinner and made him sit at \\nthe table bleeding and crying; and another stepfather, who robbed banks \\nand who. after he was caught, sent Rick ski masks he had crocheted in \\nprison. \\nReynolds\\'s one-person show led to high-powered managers, a Show\\xad\\ntime cable special, and finally a deal with NBC. He also appeared on The \\nTonight Show and Letterman and was written up in People magazine. \\nTelling the truth (in a funny way) can bring rewards. \\nChris Titus was a Star Search winner and a comedy club headliner \\nwho spent seven years on the road going nowhere. Then he wrote his one-\\nperson show Norman Rockwell Ls Bleeding, about his mother stabbing his \\nstepfather and attempting suicide, and his father\\'s alcoholism and abuse. \\n\\' he result—his own network prime-time sitcom, Titus. PRO TALK with Christopher Titus \\n\"A one-person show is not just an hour of stand-up. It has to be dra\\xad\\nmatic and funny. I tossed my stand-up aci and wrote forty minutes \\nabout my life—real stuff, scary stuff, true stuff, but always funny. 1 \\nworked on my one-person show for two years. We did it in a theater. \\nMy wife produced it, my niece did the lights.\" \\nBruce Smith, Titus\\'s agent, says, \"Chris\\'s one-person show was the \\nonly way to demonstrate to the industry that his story was irrefutably \\nfunny to a crowd and not scary. A one-person show doesn\\'t have to be \\nlaugh after laugh after laugh, but it always has to be interesting and \\nentertaining.\" \\nOne of the most successful one-person shows is Rob Becker\\'s Defend\\xad\\ning the Caveman, which took Becker from comedy clubs to a Broadway hit \\nOne night he got onstage in his stand-up act and said he was tired of all \\nthe politically correct male bashing. \"I don\\'t think we arc bad, we\\'re \\nonly different.\\'\\' And the caveman was born. \\nPRO TALK with Rob Becker \\n\"It\\'s strange. The idea for this show simply \\n(lashed in my mind. But I knew then I \\nwanted to do a show about relationships, \\nsomething that had a beginning, a middle, \\nand an end. That\\'s when I knew I needed \\nninety minutes.\" \\n\\'Who should do a one-person show?\\' \\nAnswer these questions: \\n• Do you prefer telling stories rather than jokes? \\n• Can you repeat a story and make it sound as fresh and spontaneous the \\ntenth time as you did the first? j Can you aci? \\n• Do you find it stifling to have to make people constantly laugh? \\nQ Do you have a burning desire 10 tell a particular story? \\nThen this might be for you. \\nA word of caution—doing a one-person show is not for novices. If it\\'s \\nmething you want to do, you have to work up to it. When it\\'s done \\nwell, it appears as if the performer is simply talking about themselves or \\nportraying a character from their life. If it really was that easy, we\\'d all \\nguit therapy and rent a theater. A one-person show is not just about shar\\xad\\ning stories from your \"oh-so-interesting\" life. It\\'s finding the themes in \\nvoui life that are universal, the ones that overlap with other people\\'s \\nthemes, and making them really funny. It\\'s for experienced writers and \\nperformers, not for people starting out. You can\\'t do a one-person show \\nbv the book—it\\'s an extremely personal artistic experience. To do it well, \\nwju often break the rules—but you have to really know the rules and \\nh;i\\\\ e played by them many times before you can successfully break them. \\n<S \\'o-w to Vut together Your Own \\nCne-Per$on $how \\nThe process of developing a one-person show is the same as creating new-\\nstand-up material. Don\\'t start \"funny\"; start \"deep.\" It\\'s hard not to \\nimagine the audience sitting stone-faced and silent while you explore seri\\xad\\nous topics, bui thinking of them 100 soon can choke your creativity. \\nExercise: Starting the Process—Picking a Story \\nMake a list of the turning points in your life—all the \"aha!\" moments and \\nmeaningful events. Go back to the \"Stepping-Stones of Life\" exercise on \\npage 210 for help. Start with a life-changing event rather than a funny \\none, because it\\'s a lot easier to make a dramatic story funny than to make \\nsomething that\\'s funny dramatic. Not sure if a particular event was really \\nmeaningful? Write it down anyway. Sometimes it\\'s only by exploring the \\nseemingly inconsequential details of our lives that we realize just how \\nmomentous thev were. PRO TAIK with Tim Baglty, winner of Aspen \\'99 Best One-Person \\nSlum- for Happy Hour \\n\"After winning the Aspen award for my show about a \\nbest friend\\'s death, I got the idea for my second \\nshow when 1 was reading a book about the Playboy \\nmansion.

Don\\'t worry about \\nyour spelling or grammar or if you change direct ions and flow into \\nanother event that isn\\'t even connected. Let your writing be as messy, dis\\xad\\norganized, and disjointed as it needs to be. We all want our writing to \\ncome out perfectly the first time—write it on Monday and perform it on \\nFriday. That may be possible with short stand-up pieces, but when creat\\xad\\ning a one-person show, probably everything you write dining the firsl two \\nmonths will never make it onstage—it\\'s exploratory material. \\nPRO TALK with Irene Penn, manager and director (Lily Tomlin, Reno, Kathy \\nand Mo, Sandra Bemhard, Sherry Glascr) \\n\"Write from your gut, because if it doesn\\'t move you, it\\'s not going to \\nmove anyone else. Most of us go through very similar things, or we know \\npeople who have gone through similar things, and even if your show is \\ndeeply personal, you have to find a way to connect to the audience.\" \\nI lere are some tips by renowned Los Angeles one-person coach am \\ndirector Mark Travis, \\n^ J Don\\'t worry about how the event vou are writing about will fit with any \\nother event vou want to explore.

How will I do \\nit?\" 1 have yet to find a scene that can\\'t be shaped so that it can be done \\nby one person. \\n_j Don\\'t write in past tense, such as, \"I was standing on the street corner and \\n1 saw this woman.\" It should be, \"I\\'m standing on this street corner and I \\nsee this woman.\" When you write in the present tense, your whole emo\\xad\\ntional system shifts to the inside of the story. If you work in the past \\ntense, not only do you distance yourself from the material, but you dis\\xad\\ntance the audience from it as well. \\nIn Tim Baglcy\\'s award-winning one-person show Happy Hour he \\nplaved several cocktail-guzzling members of his dysfunctional family at a \\nfamilv reunion. The show was based on a painful event—a friend\\'s death. \\n\"While I was writing it, I didn\\'t have an outline. I didn\\'t have any form. I \\nwas just kind of writing and trusting that at some point I would be able to \\npiece it together.\" \\nPRO TAIK with Tim Bagley \\n\"I just started writing about the death \\ncrazy person, sleeping during the day \\ntime, I didn\\'t know what the theme was of \\nind \\nor h my friend-\\nwriting at \\now -writing like a \\nnight. At that \\nit all connected. \\nDetail Your Story \\nfne storv you\\'ve written so far is a starting point. Now expand it by \\nfocusing in on the details. For instance, in Julia Sweeney\\'s show about \\ngetting cancer at the same time as her brother, the details for the day she \\nfound out she had cancer would include the trip to the doctor\\'s office, \\nwhat she wore that day, what the doctor\\'s waiting room looked like, what \\nhis office looked like, the way the nurses behaved, what diplomas were on \\n^\\'s waifs, what the doctor wore, whether his nails were clean. At one point in Happy I lour, Bagley goes into great detail about his \\nattempt to organize his dysfunctional clan for a family photograph. He \\nacts out each member of his family—directing his befuddled dad to stand \\nnext to a chair is harder than getting a hyper poodle to stop yapping. \\nWaking up his Bible-thumping brother-in-law from a nap almost leads to \\na physical confrontation. Tim\\'s streetwise brother agrees to pose, but only \\nif Tim agrees to listen to the obscene song he wrote. \\nMost of the \"funny\" is in the details. \\nBack Story \\nYou\\'ve written about a significant event in your life. Now write about the \\nevents that led to that experience, so that we know why this event is so \\nsignificant. What background information should we know- about the \\npeople in your story to better understand their behavior in the event? \\nTim Bagley: \\nI really try to get into what makes people behave die way they do and \\nnot some other way. You have to go deep into the characters; otherwise \\nthey come off one-dimensional. My brother talks nonstop. He\\'ll talk \\nabout everything—his new barbecue grill or working out at the gym— \\nexcept his wile dying and the pain that he\\'s experiencing. So, when I\\'m \\nin his character and chattering, I want to make sure that the audience \\nsees what is at the root of his behavior—that he is hiding behind all die \\nchatter. \\nDetail the Characters \\nA character\\'s essence—the qualities that make him or her a unique indi\\xad\\nvidual—is shown in the details. Explore the different ways your charac\\xad\\nters express their true natures by noticing all the tiny behaviors ami \\nchoices that reveal various aspects of their personalities. For instance, if \\nyour mother conies into the room in your story, notice every detail about \\nher. I low does she enter the room? Hesitantly? Shyly? Drunkenly? What \\nis she wearing? What does she smell like? Who or what does she search \\nout first? Second? What does she say? How does she stand when she \\ntalks? What does she do with her hands? In stand-up, you superficially \\nsketch characters in the act-outs, but in a one-person show you will need \\nto do finely detailed portraits of your characters so they come across a \\nthree-dimensional. Exercise: Character Act-outs \\nput each character on an index card—list their mannerisms, idiosyn\\xad\\ncrasies, and behavioral quirks—then practice them by acting them out. \\nAct out all the people in each scene. \\nTim Bagley: \"I wrote two or three different monologues for each char\\xad\\nacter in my story, and ended up using the one that I felt moved the story \\nalong.\" \\nFinding the Show \\nThere are two aspects of your show that you need to find: (1) the story \\nand (2) the theme. \\nExercise: The Story \\nBy now you might have a ton of pages of material about your event that \\nshoot off in many different tangents. To help you find the through line, \\nreduce vour material to bullet points—the events that move your story \\nalong. Write each bullet point on a separate index card. For instance, for \\nTim Bagley\\'s Happy Hour he wrote down on different cards: \"Brother \\nsings a song.\" \"Mom\\'s drunken confession.\" \"Dad giving clues.\" \\nConsider each index card as a scene, and detail each scene by an\\xad\\nswering: \\n1- What characters are in the scene? \\n2. What is the location of die scene? \\n3. What happens in the scene? \\nOrganize all your index cards into an order that tells your story. Then \\nget up on your feet and rehearse your story, using the index cards. As you \\npractice acting out the story, you will find that certain scenes feel out of \\nplace. Trust vour gut feelings and keep rearranging your cards until you \\nfeel that the whole thing flows. \\nFinding the Theme \\nSo far vou\\'ve picked an event, written all you can about it, examined and \\nexplored every detail of it, found the characters, itemized all the details \\nabout each one, and arranged the scenes in an order. You might have a very interesting story, and a couple of hours of good material, but it is not \\na show—yet. You need to know the theme of your show. \\nA theme is a universal message, a point of view or a premise that per\\xad\\nmeates every aspect of the story. All the characters and events represent \\nsome facet of the theme. \\nSome performers know their theme right from the beginning. Others \\nspend years finding it. Rob Becker did years of research, reading books \\nand articles and talking with marriage and family experts, before coming \\nup with his theme for Defending the Caveman: \"We are not far removed \\nfrom our prehistoric roles. Men remain hunters, women gatherers, and \\nthere will always be friction unless the two honor their differences and \\nexplore each other\\'s \\'worlds\\' without judgment.\" And that was his show. \\nSometimes it\\'s extremely difficult for the writer/performer to figure \\nout what the theme of the show is. As director Mark Travis says, \"You will \\nbe the last one to know where or what it is because you are the main char\\xad\\nacter, and as the main character, you are not sufficiently removed from \\nwhat\\'s going on to know the true theme of your story.\" \\nTim Baglcy found the theme of Happy Hour in a moment of insight: \\nOnce I wrote everybody, I saw that, without realizing it, I had revealed \\nhow my siblings and my parents each have their own unique way of hid\\xad\\ning. And then I thought, \"I haven\\'t written about how I hide because I\\'ve \\nbeen hiding my friend\\'s death from my family.\" And then it came to \\nme—that\\'s my theme. My friend\\'s death brings truth into my menagerie \\nof denial. I knew that I had to do a monologue thai explains all that I \\nhave hidden, and that was my show. \\nExercise: Finding the Theme \\nLearn about themes by examining the structure of a variety of movies, \\nplays, and one-person shows. Answer these questions: \\n1. What is the plot of the story (in just a few sentences)? \\n2. What is the story really about? \\n3. Tell the through line of the story, using the main character. For example. \\nCone With the Wind is about Scarlett O\\'Hara, who through her stubborn \\noptimism survives great tragedy. \"Tomorrow is another day . . .\" \\n4. I low does the main character change during the course of the story? \\n5. Why is the story interesting to you? \\n6. What conflict or idea resonates through the story and drives this mate-\\n/ rial? (It\\'s usually something much more profound than just the events of \\nthe story itself.) \\nGetting Perspective \\nTo find out what your show is really about, you\\'ll probably need to get a \\nlittle distance from it. Put it away for a few weeks. When you come back \\nto it. read it as if someone else wrote it and look for the theme. Even bet\\xad\\nter, enlist the help of a director or a coach to help you to fine-tune the \\ntheme and the structure. \\nTips on Structure \\n• The audience should always wonder, \"What\\'s going to happen?\" That \\nmeans that every element of the story should build up to the end. which \\ncontains some sort of revealing information. \\n• Hook the audience in the first five minutes by giving them a sense of \\nwhat the story is about. \\n• Keep the show in present tense. \\n• Don\\'t describe your characters, act them out. \\n• Pick a storv that is emotionally meaningful to you because you are going \\nto be telling it over and over again (if it\\'s successful). If you\\'re telling this \\nstorv only to \"be funny\" or because you hope it will land you a job, you \\nwon\\'t make it. \\n• Think of your one-person show as a play where you play all the char\\xad\\nacters. \\n• (let a director, coach, or comedy buddy to work on the show with you. \\nAnother option—work on vour piece in a class. You need a fresh, emo\\xad\\ntionally detached pair of eyes to look at it and tell you how much of what \\nis in your head is actually coming out onstage. Many universities have \\nadult extension classes in the arts. See my Web site for one-person show \\ncoaches. \\n• Don\\'t sermonize and tell the audience what the theme is and how they \\nshould respond. Your place is inside the story—reacting to what\\'s going \\non as it\\'s happening at that moment. Let the audience make their own \\njudgment at the end as to what it\\'s about and how they feel about you. \\nDirector Mark Travis sums it up by saying, \"Your approach should be, \\n\\'I\\'m going to lake you on an extraordinary journev. 1 went on it and I\\'m \\ngoing to go on it with you.\\' \" \\n• Know what the theme of your show is. it might be based on your life, but it has to say something about nil human beings in order (o touch the \\naudience, Jusi as with stand-up, it has to be rdatable. \\ni Is Bleeding included in his press release that he watched his mother kill his \\nstepfather. This was intriguing enough 10 gel out a lot of the press and \\nindustry people. \\nDoing a one-person show is an act of passion and love—but it might \\nnot make you a cent, even if it\\'s really good. If you break even doing a \\none-person show, consider yourself extremely lucky. \\nUnlike a TV show or a film, a one-person show can be a work, in progress \\nfor years. There\\'s only so much you can learn about your show from writ\\xad\\ning it. You\\'ll learn a lot more from performing it in a workshop and get\\xad\\nting feedback. It can take years of performing, getting input, rewriting, \\nreworking, and then performing it again to get it to the point where you \\ncan invite the public to your show. \\nTips on producing your show: \\n• Don\\'t spend a lot of money on mounting your show. No matter how \\ngood or ready you think it is, chances are it still needs work. Most one-\\nperson shows don\\'t depend on sets, props, or costumes for success. The \\nstory is the star. Find a space where you can invite ten to twenty people \\nto watch. Churches, temples, schools, and even some community centers \\nhave small theaters that they rent out for a minimal fee. \\n• Hold a discussion afterward so people can give feedback. Occasionally \\nsomeone will say something that will help you make the production bet\\xad\\nter. It\\'s hard not to defend yourself when people give negative comments, \\nbut the best thing to do is just write down what they say. Then trust your \\ninstincts, use what you can, and toss the rest away. \\nHere are some tips from Leigh Fortier, a Los Angeles award-winning \\ntheater producer, on how to produce a one-person show in Los Angeles \\n(or another big city). \\n• Hire a good director who specializes in doing the kind of show you wani \\nto do. Get the best person vou can possibly afford—this is not an area to \\ncut corners. Look at other projects they\\'ve developed and directed before \\nmaking a decision. \\n• Do two or three performances for a select group of friends before inviting \\nthe public. Don\\'t invite the press until the show is as good as you can pos\\xad\\nsibly make it—all the rough spots polished and all the kinks worked out. \\n• Create a provocative press release. Target it to the newspaper and maga\\xad\\nzine arts editors who specialize in theater. Chris Titus in Norman llockm\\'U •i? ook at the staff of any TV sitcom and you will find writers who \\n•Upstarted as stand-up comics or who have had at least one open-mike \\nexperience. As I said before, performing comedy is key to writing comedy, in \\norder to get a hands-on sense of all the elements of a joke—timing, alti\\xad\\ntude, and delivery. If you just want to be a stand-up and enjoy working \\nthe road, then skip this chapter and become the best stand-up you can \\nbe. Write jokes every day and find a place to perform every night. How\\xad\\never, there are many stand-ups who do both—they work on a sitcom staff \\nduring the TV season and off-season they are on the road. \\n1. It\\'s a way to get an agent or a manager. When presenting yourseli to an \\nagent, it\\'s a plus to have things for them to sell other than just being a \\nperformer. \\n2. Greed. Generally writers make more money than stand-up comics, and it \\nyou are on staff, you get a steady paycheck and it\\'s a big one. \\n3. If you write a good spec script, it can lead to a writing assignment. \\n4. You don\\'t have to travel. Although fun at first, the road can be wearing \\n5. It\\'s an outlet for creative ideas that don\\'t lend themselves to the stand-up \\nformat. (>. It\\'s a nesting place for stories that don\\'t til into your act. \\n7. It\\'s a good outlet for character coined). \\n,S. It gives you a chance to be part of a team rather than always working \\nalone. \\n9. It\\'s a great way to network to get more stand-up jobs. Garry Shandling, \\nferry Seinfeld, Gonan O\\'Brien, and David Letterman all worked as writ\\xad\\ners on TV \\n10. Free doughnuts. \\nPractically everyone who has ever produced or written on a sitcom \\nstarted by writing many spec, or sample, scripts. Spec is short for specula\\xad\\ntion or speculative. A spec script is usually an episode of an existing TV \\nshow that you write for no pav, because you\\'re speculating that it will get \\nyou a job. Spec scripts—don\\'t try to get a job without one. \\nAnd it\\'s not just neophyte writers who write spec scripts. After being \\nco-executive producer for Everybody Loves Raymond, Cindy Chupack still \\nhad to submit relevant fresh material when she was up for IIBO\\'s Sex in \\nthe City. \\n\"How much do spec scripts sell for?\" \\nYou have a better chance of winning the tristate lottery than you have \\nof selling your spec scripts. Even if it\\'s the funniest, most brilliant script \\never, it might get you a writing assignment or a staff position, but pro\\xad\\nducers rarely buy a spec script. It\\'s strictly a way to get your talent \\nnoticed. \\nMy life would make a good sitcom. Wouldn\\'t it be a good idea to \\n\"rite an original sitcom based on my wacky life?\" \\nA lot of beginning comics write original sitcom scripts, hoping to star \\nHi them. These scripts are called pilots—original shows. As they get more \\nsophisticated about the business, they realize that pilots are developed \\nwith extremely successful producers or stars and packaged by powerful \\n\"gencies. Even if you write a really terrific pilot, unless you are a star, it is \\nI er>\\' unlikely that anyone will spend a million dollars producing your sit-com with you in it. And an original script won\\'t gel you a job writing Qn \\ncurrent sitcoms unless you have some spec scripts as well. There is really \\nno way around it—if you want to get a job writing sitcoms, you have to \\nhave written some spec scripts. \\nWriting sitcoms is not so different from writing jokes. A joke has an \\nattitude, topic, premise, act-out, and mix. Sitcoms incorporate the same \\nelements. \\nAttitude. Each character has a specific attitude. The way they react to \\none another creates your story \\nTopic. Each episode of a sitcom is usually about one or two topics \\nLike a stand-up topic, it\\'s something very ordinary rather than unique or \\nweird. Just like stand-up, it\\'s not the topic that makes your work unique, \\nit\\'s what you do with the topic. \\nPremise. This is the log line, the one-sentence synopsis of the story. It \\nis usually structured like this: When something happens to the hero, he \\ntries something and gets into more trouble. For example: (Seinfeld) When \\nthe Internal Revenue Service seeks to audit Jerry, George arranges for his \\ngirlfriend, who once worked for the Internal Revenue Service, to help \\nJerry out. (Frasier) When Frasier falls for an attractive traffic cop, it turns \\nout that she would rather date Martin. \\nAct-out is dialogue. \\nMix creates the situation when you bring in an element that will create \\nconflict with the characters. (Ellen) When Ellen meets an openly gay \\nwoman, it makes her confront her own sexuality. \\nPRO TALK with Abraham Lincoln, president of the United States \\n\"If I had eight hours to cut down a tree, I\\'d spend six hours sharpening \\nmy axe.\" \\nBefore you begin the actual writing of your spec script, there is a lot \\nof prep work to do. This can take anywhere from a few weeks to several \\nmonths. Don\\'t rush this prep work. Be thorough. When you build a \\nhouse, most of the time is spent on the plans, because a house built wit\\'1 \\n/ I a faulty design will collapse. If you rush ahead and start writing your \\nScript without doing the necessary prep work, you will probably end up \\nwith a script that doesn\\'t work. \\n\"Should I write with someone?\" \\nIf you have a comedy buddy that you work well with, yon might want \\nto write a spec script together. There are advantages to writing with some\\xad\\none. Besides having someone to bounce ideas off, a lot of sitcoms hire \\nwriting teams. The downside is that you will have to split your salary and \\nf you will not be able to get a job as a solo writer with a jointly written \\nspec script. But hey, half a salary is still going to be more than working at \\nf Sizzler. \\nPRO TALK with Cindy Cliupack, producer/writer \\n\"Pick a partner who has complimentary skills to you. My partner was \\nmuch better at structure than I was when we first started out. I learned \\nfrom her and our whole product became better than what we could \\nhave done individually.\" \\nThe first step is picking the sitcom you are going to write. Watch TV sit\\xad\\ncoms intensively for two weeks. Then answer these questions: \\n1 • Which show makes you laugh? Don\\'t bother picking a show just because \\nit\\'s popular. You have to find it funny or you will get bored trying to \\nwrite it. \\n2. Does the show have a character on it who has your voice? Is there some\\xad\\none like you on the show? If you have a day job as a secretary, you might \\nwant to pick a show that lakes place in an office environment. Maybe a \\ncharacter on the show has a relationship similar to one you have. For \\ninstance, a show might center around the relationship of two brothers \\nthat resembles your relationship with your brother. \\n3. Does the show have legs? In other words, is this show going to be around for a while? You can\\'t use a spec script for a show that is off the air. So \\nunless you want to keep writing new spec scripts every few weeks, pick \\none that\\'s doing well enough in the ratings to be picked up for a few more \\nseasons. \\n4. Is this show well liked and well respected by the industry? It\\'s hard \\nenough to gel someone to read any spec script, let alone a script for a \\nshow they hate- And no matter how good your script is. if the show itself \\nis thought to be bad writing, your script will suffer from guilt by associa\\xad\\ntion. Some shows don\\'t get high ratings but are noted as well-written, hot \\nshows. It doesn\\'t matter if the show is a cable show, as long as it\\'s gener\\xad\\nally regarded as a high-quality show. \\n5. Is this show too popular? If it is, you\\'ll be one of a million writers doing \\nspec scripts on it. Under these conditions, it\\'s harder to come up with a \\nstory idea that\\'s not already done, and harder to stand out and be com\\xad\\npared to everyone else. \\n\"My dream job would be getting a staff job on Friends. Should I write \\na Friends spec script?\" \\nWriters rarely get hired on the show for which they did a spec script. \\nMost producers won\\'t even read a spec script for their show. In addition \\nto the fact that they know the characters and the show better than you \\never possibly could, they don\\'t want to read something similar to some\\xad\\nthing in development and get sued. The best way to be considered for a \\nwriting job on Friends is to submit a killer spec script of another sitcom \\nthat has a similar tone. \\nMy spec script is for . \\nThis is the hardest part of the spec script section. You\\'re going to have to \\nfind someone who can got you a script, and even harder, program your \\nVCR to (ape your show. AHHIIHH! \\nOnce you have picked your show, you\\'ll need to get your paws on at \\nleast three scripts of the show and videotape at least six different episodes. \\n\"How do I get my paws on a sitcom script?\" \\nI Go on the Interne! and search for places that sell sitcom studio scripts, \\nsuch as http:HmmJ10Bynoodbo0tety.com. Make sure that you are getting \\noriginal studio scripts that have the original formatting, rather than \\nscripts that have been transcribed. \\n, If you can\\'t buy a copy of the sitcom you want to write, call the show \\ndirectly. Many shows do sell scripts. \\na If there is an episode you really liked, send a note to the writer (in care of \\nthe show). Tell them you are a beginning writer and are a great fan of their \\nwork. Ask them if they would please autograph a copy of their script for \\nyou. Most writers will be thrilled to have a fan. Be sure to send a self-\\naddressed, stamped envelope with your note, but don\\'t harass them. \\n• Rack your brains for a connection to someone who works on a show7. \\nYou might figure out that your cousin Sally used to date this guy Fred \\nwho lives next door to Barney, the script assistaitl on your favorite show. \\nCall him. \\nEach\\n  TV sitcom has its own structure, and you need to know what it is. \\nThe person reading your script needs to know that you can nail a charac\\xad\\nter\\'s voice, the tone of the show, and even the way it\\'s laid out on the \\npage. Each sitcom has its own quirks, and you need to know them inside \\nout. Your script could be brilliant but no one will even know because they \\nwon\\'t read past the first page if it\\'s not formatted properly. \\nExercise: Breaking Down the Sitcom Structure \\nEllen Sandler, who was co-executive producer of the hit show Everybody \\nLoves Raymond as well as having staff positions on many other sitcoms, \\noffers advice on dissecting a show\\'s structure. \\nYou have to get at least three scripts of a series to figure out the show\\'s basic \\nstructure. From watching the show, answer these questions: \\n• How many scenes are in the show-? \\n• How many times does the lead actor appear? \\n• I low many jokes are on a page? \\n• What are the main locations, and how many times are the characters in \\neach one? \\n• How many scenes is each character in? • How many pages is each scene? \\n• What is the style of the show—jokey, physical humor, irreverent? \\n• Is there a B-story (a subplot that\\'s not the main focus of the show but \\nsi ill important)? Is there more than one B-story? \\n• I low many pages are devoted to the B-stories? \\n• What is the relationship between the A-story and the B-story? Are thev \\nconnected by a similar theme, as in IIBO\\'s Sex in the City? Does the \\nB-story counterpoint the A-story? Do all the stories dovetail at the end\\' \\nOr is there no connection between the stories? \\n• Is there a pattern in the dialogue? Does one character always have the \\nfinal say? \\n• Is one character\\'s humor physical? \\n• Who is the viewing audience? \\n• How racy does the dialogue get? \\n• Are there guest or recurring characters? How many in an episode? How \\nmany pages do they take up? \\n• Does the sitcom happen in two, or three, acts? \\n• Where are the act breaks? Where do the commercials come in? \\n• Can you find any other consistencies between the three episodes? \\nDo not skip any of the above questions, because these answers will \\nbecome your template for writing an original episode. Wrong answers or \\nincomplete information will lead to script problems later on. If you don\\'t \\nknow an answer, reread or review the show until you do. \\nExercise: Sitcom Structure \\nIn order to truly understand the structure of the sitcom you selected, as \\nyou watch the six episodes you taped, write out what happens in each \\nscene and where it happens. Later, when you write the spec script, you will \\nuse these notes as a road map to understand the structure of your show. \\nFor example, an episode in Everybody Loves Raymond might look like \\nthis: \\nScene 1—INT. [interior] Ray and Debra\\'s kitchen \\nAmy is crying to Dcbra that she and Robert broke up again. She realizes \\nthat in the past she has been attracted to gay men and wonders if \\nRobert might be gay. \\nScene 2—[NT. Ray and Debra\\'s bedroom—night \\nDebra asks Ray if he thinks his brother Robert might he gav. This annoys IRay. Debra gets angry at Ray for being so closed-minded and feels \\nthai Ray\\'s family would not be very sympathetic or supportive if \\nRobert were gay. \\nSitcom structure is very simple, according to Bill Idelson (Get Smart, Andy \\nGriffith, Vie Odd Couple, Happy Days, M*A*S*H, author of Writing for \\n\\'. Dough). \\nAll stories have these elements: a hero, the hero\\'s goal, and the obstacle \\nto the hero obtaining that goal. Someone wants something and there is \\nsomething stopping him. Look at lack and the Beanstalk. Jack (the hero) \\nwants to help his poor mother (goal). He gets magic beans and climbs \\nthe beanstalk to the riches at the end, but there is a giant (obstacle). \\n•klelson is right. As basic as the structure of that old tale is, it is no dif\\xad\\nferent from that of modern-day sitcoms. A sitcom story is usually broken \\ndown into six beats: \\n1. Setup—there is a problem in paradise. \\n2. Complicates and escalates—the problem gets bigger. \\n3. Twist (act break)—things don\\'t go the way the characters thought they \\nwould. \\n4. The characters plan what to do about what just happened. \\n5. The conflict gets bigger as they execute the plan—this is the big physical \\nor emotional comedy scene. \\n6. The situation gets resolved—all the loose ends of the story are wrapped \\nup, and usually the main character has a heartfelt moment and learns \\nsome kind of lesson about life. \\nHere is an example from an Everybody Lores Raymond episode broken \\ndown into the six story beats: \\n1. Setup—Amy breaks up with Robert, and both Debra and Amy consider if \\nRobert is gay \\n2. Complicates—Debra is pissed at Ray for being closed-minded about the \\npossibility of his brother being gay. 3. Twist (act break)—Ray wondering if Debra is right about his family being \\nclosed-minded about the gay issue, asks his parents how they would react \\nif someone in the family were gay. Ray\\'s parents think that he\\'s telling \\nlitem thai Robert is gay—his father is horrified and his mother is surpris\\xad\\ningly line. When Robert comes in, his mother tells him that it\\'s \"OK to \\nbe gay.\" Commercial. \\n4. The plan—The family tries to accept that Robert is gay \\n5. The conflict escalates—Robert is confused; if his whole family thinks he\\'s \\ngay, maybe he is, Ray comes over to apologize for starling this mess and \\nstarts to wonder if he also is gay Then their father comes over angry from \\na fight with his wife and says, \"Women. Who needs \\'em?\" Now Ray and \\nRobert think that Frank might be gay. Commercial. \\n6. Resolve—Robert forgives Raymond for starting ihe mess. Ray makes \\npeace with Debra by staying home with her and her friends rather than \\ngoing out with the guys. He realizes that he\\'s straight—but miserable. \\nThe goal of the main character, Rav, is to make Debra happy by show\\xad\\ning that he and his family are not homophobic. \\nThe obstacles are his father\\'s homophobia and his own homophobia. \\nNow write out the six beats of an episode of a sitcom according to the \\nabove template, then answer these questions: \\n• What happens in each step? \\n• How many pages is each step? \\n• Where are the commercial breaks? \\n• What is the goal of the main character? \\n• What are the obstacles? \\nLog Line \\nLook at the scene breakdown of the sitcom you are researching and write \\nout the basic log line of the story in this format: \"When something hap\\xad\\npens to the hero, he tries something and gets into more trouble.\" \\nThe log line for the above story would be: \\n(Everybody Loves Raymond) When Robert and Amy hreak up again the \\nfamily starts to wonder if he might be gay \\nLog lines can be found in TV Guide or on the show\\'s Internet sites. (Sex in (he City) When Carrie runs into Mr Big\\'s seemingly perfect \\nNatasha, she wonders: Are there women in New York City who live for \\nthe sole purpose of making other women feel bad about themselves? \\n(family Guy) When the trophy turns up missing that Peter and his neigh\\xad\\nbors won in the annual 1 larvcst Festival Parade, the winners all suspect \\none another of stealing it. \\nExercise: Log Line \\nWrite out the log line from an episode of the sitcom you are researching. \\nLog line: \\nPRO TALK with Ellen Sandler \\n\"Don\\'t underestimate the importance of the page layout. When I have \\na huge stack of scripts to read, I\\'m looking for any reason to get out of \\nreading them. So if a script isn\\'t in the right form, or if a character\\'s \\nname is misspelled. I think. This writer is not up to speed,\\' and I don\\'t \\nread it. A good agent will never send out a script that is not formatted \\nproperly.\" Examine your sample scripts for their formatting. Each sitcom has differ\\xad\\nent formatting. Some have long character descriptions, some none. Some \\nhave huge margins, some small. Some have parenthetical descriptions for \\nthe actors, such as \"crying loudly\" or \"shouting,\" and some sitcoms hate \\nthem. You need to know the preferences of the sitcom you\\'re writing for. \\nEven if the producers of that show never read your script, the producers \\nof other shows will know that show\\'s format and it will make your script \\nlook more professional. Although each show has a slightly different format, here\\'s the tem\\xad\\nplate for the standard format. This is excerpted from Tony Pelzer\\'s Web \\nsite www.siteom-net.com. \\nScripts begin with the title centered, capitalized, and underlined at the \\ntop of the page. Then the act number and scene letter follow below \\nunderlined. All scripts start with a left justified \"FADE IN:\" and end \\nwith a right justified \"FADE OUT.\" The font is usually Courier, 12 point. \\nEach scene begins with a slugline that includes where and when the \\nscene takes place. There are at least three parts to this slugline: whether \\nthe scene occurs indoors (\"INT.\") or outdoors (\"EXT\"), the location of \\nthe scene, and when it happens. \\nAction is ALL typed in CAPITALS and is single spaced and enclosed in \\nparentheses. Double spacing makes the script longer because it adds lots \\nof white space so figure each page is approximately 30 seconds. Everything is capitalized except the dialogue; this includes set \\ndescriptions and the character\\'s actions. \\nWhen writing dialogue, the character\\'s name is centered at approxi\\xad\\nmately 3.5\" from the left. Dialogue is centered under the character\\'s \\nname at approximately 2.5\". You must leave 3-4 inches on the right mar\\xad\\ngin so the director can mark notes. If a character is going to continue \\nspeaking on die next page, then a centered \"(MORE)\" needs to be added \\nat the bottom and a \"(CONT\\'D)\" needs to be added after the character\\'s \\nname on the following page. \\nNORM (CONT\\'D) \\nNorm continues speaking. \\nEach scene or act begins on a new page and pages are numbered in the \\nupper right. New scenes are capitalized and underlined along with cam\\xad\\nera directions. \\nSet up your computer for sitcom writing.

There arc also software programs lor writing \\nsitcoms and screenplays, but they are expensive and you can do the same \\nthing with ordinary word processing programs by creating a sitcom tem\\xad\\nplate. \\nIf you don\\'t have a computer, don\\'t fret. Emmy award—winner David \\nE- Kelley writes on a legal pad and someone else types it up. There are many services that will convert your chicken scratch into a formal sitcom \\nscript. Go to our Web site for recommendations for this service as well as \\nprofessional scriptwriting software. \\nWhen you go on a trip, the first decision you make is where you want to \\nend up, and usually it\\'s the same when you start to write something. \\nSometimes completing a script can seem like an overwhelming undertak\\xad\\ning. That\\'s why many anxious writers find that it\\'s psychologically help\\xad\\nful to have a \"pretend\" finished project as a reminder that writing a sit\\xad\\ncom is not brain surgery, it\\'s about filling in forty-live pages. So, gather \\nforty-six blank sheets of paper and create your title page on the top sheet. \\nIt should look something like this: \\nYou probably won\\'t know your episode title until you\\'re done, so for \\nnow just put a temporary title on it. You may register your script with the \\nWriters Guild online (www.awg.com.au or www.nzwritcrsguild.org.nz) to \\nprotect yourself from illegal use. Punch three holes, fasten the page \\ntogether with brads (paper fasteners), and put this pretend script on your \\ndesk, by your bed, or wherever you can see it every day as a reminder that \\nit\\'s just about filling in forty-five pages. \\nJust as expectant parents furnish the nursery before the baby is born, you \\nneed to prepare a nurturing environment for your spec script project too. \\nThat means setting up both a place and a time to write. My favorite time \\nto write is in the morning, and my favorite place is in bed on my laptop. \\n1 have to write first thing in the morning; otherwise, if I check mv e-mail, \\ngo on the Internet, or return calls, 1 never get to the writing. The time \\nand place for you to write might be different from mine. I know of some \\nwriters who get up at 3 A.M. to write and then go back to sleep. Some \\nwriters need quiet and some prefer writing in the middle of hotel lobbies, \\nk doesn\\'t matter where or when you write, but what does matter is your \\ncommitment to it—every day until you are finished. Make that commit\\xad\\nment now. \\nI commit to writing the sitcom until all forty-five pages are done. I will write every day at \\nThe place I prefer writing is . \\nThe real world operates on deadlines and so should you. If you were \\ndiligent doing the prep work, by following the instructions in the follow\\xad\\ning section you will have a finished script nineteen days from now. Write \\nthat date down here. It\\'s your deadline. \\nDate: \\nAction Checklist \\n-1 picked a show \\n^ watched and outlined six episodes \\n0 read at least three scripts of the show \\n\\'-I outlined each episode of the show \\nQ set up my computer to conform to the formatting of the show \\nQ committed to a finish date \\n3 committed to a time and place to write 4. Don\\'t make your story weird. Even with all their moments of exaggera\\xad\\ntion, sitcoms are pretty realistic. In the classic All in the Family, all the sto\\xad\\nries centered on the family members talking to one another and neigh\\xad\\nbors coming over—in other words, typical family life. There was never an \\nepisode where aliens landed and one-eyed creatures came over. Even if \\nthe show is based on an alien family, such as Third Rock from the Sun, the \\nstory lines involve relatively normal, mundane matters. \\n5. Don\\'t force the characters into your story. Just because you have a great \\nstory that \"really happened to you\" doesn\\'t mean that it should happen \\nto the characters in the sitcom. Events should appear to happen because \\nof the characters\\' personalities not because of the writer\\'s imagination. \\n6. Don\\'t have a character say anything that is out of character. Study the \\nsitcom until you hum their voices. \\n7. Don\\'t create a story that has been done before. Go to the show\\'s site on \\nthe Internet because most major shows have synopses of all episodes. \\n8. Don\\'t add a lot of guest characters. Even better, don\\'t have any, if possi\\xad\\nble, or if you do, make them characters with recurring roles. Keep the \\nstory focused on the main and secondary characters and show how much \\nyou can do with them. \\n9. Don\\'t use gimmicks to create a story, such as one in which someone wins \\nthe lottery or goes on a game show. The story should be generated by the \\ncharacters and not by an external event. \\n10. Even if your show occasionally adds new locations, stick to the usual sets. \\n6etting Your Story Started \\nPRO TALK with John Truby, Truby\\'s writers studio, stoiy coach \\n\"The biggest mistake writers make when trying to break into sitcoms is \\nto think they must have as many jokes in the script as possible.

If the show is Fresh \\nPrince of Bel Air, you don\\'t want to write a script where they decide to \\nmove to Las Vegas. Or, \"Frasier has a terminal illness.\" Not a good idea to \\nknock off the lead character. \\n2. Don\\'t give any main characters some back story that we haven\\'t heard \\nabout, such as, \"Ross and Monica in Friends find out they have a half sister. \\n3. Don\\'t do anything different from what you learned by dissecting the show \\nFor instance, if the show always takes place in the bedroom and the living \\nroom, don\\'t put a sex store scene in your script. Keep to the format. flaws. Put that character into a situation lhat will trigger his or her flaws. \\nFor instance, in Everybody Loves Raymond, Raymond\\'s character flaw is \\nthat he feels responsible for the happiness of his entire family. Good situ\\xad\\nations would be ones where the solution for one family member\\'s prob\\xad\\nlem would cause another one\\'s misery. On Seinfeld, George\\'s character \\nflaw is that he has an unrealistic sense of entitlement. So a situation thai \\ncould flow out of that would be when George tries to go out with women \\nwho are out ol his league. \\nExercise: Character Flaws \\nWhat are your lead character\\'s flaws? \\nIn general terms, what situation would trigger his or her flaw? \\nDon\\'t go with your first and only idea. Create a list of many ideas, \\nboth A-stories and B-stories. \\nNeed some help coming up with story ideas? \\n• Start with a premise. \\n• Start with a story about something that happened to you. \\n• Start with a current-event topic. \\nRead on for the specifics . . . \\nTurning Stand-up Premises into Sitcom Stories \\nStand-up premises often translate nicely into sitcom themes. Again, think \\nin terms of insights rather than thinking funny. The entire premise of \\nChristopher Titus\\'s sitcom, Titus, was taken from his act. \\nSixty-three percent ol American families are now considered dysfunc\\xad\\ntional. That means that we\\'re now the majority. We\\'re the normal ones. \\nI It\\'s the people who have a mom and S dad and a white picket fence— \\nthose people are the freaks. \\nSome stand-up premises that could work as sitcom story lines: \\n(From a student) It\\'s hard being a black woman in corporate America \\nbecause you use a different personality with your boss than the one you \\nuse with vour ghetto friends. \\n(From my net) It\\'s weird falling in love on a vacation. When you have an \\naffair on a vacation, don\\'t mistake it for a real relationship, hecause your \\nlover has on their \"vacation personality\" You are not in a relationship, \\nyou arc in a vacationship. \\nExercise: Picking Premises \\nWrite down three of the strongest premises of your act that could also be \\nan opinion of one of the lead characters in the sitcom you picked. \\nJ. \\n2. \\n3. \\nNow write out how these premises could translate into sitcom plots. \\nFor example, my stand-up premise of \"vacationships\" in the example \\nabove could translate into a situation on the family sitcom Everybody Loves \\nRaymond. Ihe basic situation of that show is that Ray and his wife live \\nacross the street from his parents, so he is always caught between trying \\nto please his parents and trying to keep his wife happy. Using my premise, \\nthe log line might be: \"Wlien Ray and his wife invite over a madly-in-love cou\\xad\\nple they met on vacation, it makes them question their own relationship.\" Taking \\nthis premise to the next level, perhaps watching the love-crazed couple \\ngets Ray\\'s wife to thinking that he is more attentive to his parents than to \\nher. So Ray decides to make his wife happy by being more romantic \\n(goal). The obstacles to this could be (a) his mother has the flu and needs \\nhim to take care of her and (b) the difference between what men and \\nwomen consider to be romantic. a Forgetting a dale\\'s name \\na trying to get a promotion \\na trying to get rid of a bad smell in a car \\nPRO TALK with Carol Leifer, writer/\\'producer on Seinfeld \\n\"At the beginning of the season the writers pitched story ideas to Larry \\nDavid [executive producer] and Jerry—and a lot of them were things \\nthat happened to us. I wrote an episode called \\'The Beard.\\' It was \\nwhere Elaine is a beard for a gay guy. That was inspired by a real event. \\n1 actually went on a date with a gay friend of mine who is closeted and \\nasked me to go to the Hollywood Bowl with him and his boss. In real \\nlife we didn\\'t pretend that I was his wife, but you take poetic license \\nwhen writing a sitcom—you amp it up in other ways. In the script \\nElaine and the guy were all over each other.\" \\nStory ideas can come from stupid things. Sitcom wTtter/producer Ed \\nYeager got the story idea for his spec script from his baby-sitter. \"She told \\nme that somebody gave her a rat that they didn\\'t even want. Then the rat \\ngot sick and had a tumor removed. 1 thought that that was funny and \\nworked it into my spec script.\" \\nPeople who work on sitcoms become story collectors. Very often the \\nproducer will open a writers\\' meeting with, \"What\\'s going on with every\\xad\\none today? What happened over the weekend?\" And it\\'s not because pro\\xad\\nducers care about the writers\\' personal lives; they care about good stories. \\nSitcom writers pay attention to things that are problems or things that \\nare frustrating or perplexing. This becomes the starting point for a story \\nthat is then shaped according to how the characters\\' world responds to \\nthai situation. \\nFor instance, Rob Lotterstein and his partner Ellen Idelson went to \\npitch story ideas for Will and Grace, a sitcom about a straight woman who \\nfives with a gay man. They took an incident from their own lives—an \\nactor who visited their office and flirted with both of them—and turned it \\ninto a two-minute pitch. Will and Grace have an attractive guy flirt with \\nthem and they don\\'t know which of them he is flirting with. They need to \\ntind out if he is gav (goal). They can\\'t just ask him (obstacles). They make \\na plan to break into his house and go through his things, only to get in big \\ntrouble. The pilch got them a writing assignment. 1.

The \\nstories, however, must be relatable to most people. The TV series Seinfeld, \\nalthough supposedly about \"nothing,\" was really about the topics that we \\nall deal with on a daily basis—alienation, rejection, sell-loathing, under\\xad\\nemployment, indifference, and bad personal habits. On Seinfeld these top\\xad\\nics transformed into plot lines such as \\n• getting lost in a parking lot \\n• pretending someone\\'s ugly baby is cute Exercise: Writing Out Stories \\nWrite out some of your favorite stories. You know, the ones you tell at \\nparties that always get big laughs. Then plug these stories into your sit\\xad\\ncom and come up with three different log lines. \\nSitcoms mirror the hot topics of the moment—a character thinks about \\ngetting a tattoo; a character feels that her husband is addicted to the com\\xad\\nputer; a character sucks up to someone to get into a stock offering. Stand-\\nup/writer Steve Marmel has this joke about the homeless: \\n\"I was walking down the street and this guy asked me for a quarter. I try to have \\nsympathy for the homeless, I really do.

It doesn\\'t have to be interesting \\nor funny; this is just a way io see how a story can develop from just one \\nline. Exercise: Write a Letter \\nSitcom writer/producer Ellen Sandler suggests writing a letter from the \\nmain character to a close friend, telling the story. For instance, if Every\\xad\\nbody Loves Raymond is the sitcom, and if the premise is that falling in love \\nwith someone you meet on a vacation is a bad idea, the letter from Rav-\\nmond could be: \\nDear Bill. \\nI ihought things were going well wiili mv wife.

What could I do? I \\ncouldn\\'t leave her stranded. Talk about a lose-lose situation. Hut Debra \\nsaid that it I were realiv in love with her, I would treat her the way Gerry \\ntreats Linda.

Hverything I do ends up \\nbeing stupid and wrong. Next thing I know, Debra wants to go visit this \\nguy she used to date in high school. So my brother, the cop, gives me \\nthis surefire plan for romance. Well, everything went wrong. I got all of \\nthese candles and accidentally set fire to the curtains and practically \\nburned down (he house. Debra stopped speaking to me because of that. \\nThen Linda came over to return something and told us that Gerry \\ndumped her.

By doing this, you will be able to see if and when the other person \\ngets bored. Ideas will probably come to you as you tell the story, plus \\nyou\\'ll discover which aspects you want to emphasize. \\nSitcoms are character driven, which means the story should unfold due to \\nthe characters\\' conflicts with one another. Events don\\'t happen because \\nthe writer wants them to or because they arc funny. Instead, one charac\\xad\\nter\\'s needs collide with another character\\'s needs and this creates the sit\\xad\\nuation. Each story contains a lesson the character needs to learn or a \\nproblem they have to solve. \\nPRO TALK with John Truby, writing coach/story consultant \\n\"It is important to come up with a unique desire line [goal] that gets \\nthe hero in trouble. This trouble will then escalate. The humor then \\ncomes from the situation that the hero himself has caused. Once you \\nhave established the hero\\'s trouble, take it to the farthest extreme. Of \\ncourse, none of this is easy. But if you think dense story, you\\'ve got a \\ngood shot at a script that will get you through the door.\" \\nExercise: Reviewing Your Story \\nListen to the tape where you told your story to a friend. Notice the ebb \\nand flow of the story and ask yourself these questions: \\n1. Is there a place where the story became boring? \\n2. Is the story realistic? Would these characters really react the way you \\nhave them reacting? \\n3. Is the story character-driven? In other words, do the characters\\' person\\xad\\nalities and desires create the story, or does something external happen to \\nthe characters? \\n4. Is the story too big or too weird? Don\\'t create a life-changing (or show-\\nchanging) event for the main characters. For instance, don\\'t have some\\xad\\none get breast implants. Instead, have them think about getting a breast \\njob. Let the character explore the idea and how it would affect their rela\\xad\\ntionships and life. \\n5. Does the main character have a strong goal that he or she is pursuing? 6. What are the obstacles that impede the character from achieving his or \\nher goals? \\nGoal/Obstacles \\nConflict is the source of comedy and is created by obstacles, which can be \\nphysical or emotional. Humor is created from the gap between what the \\ncharacter wants to happen (goal) and the things that stand in the way of \\ngetting what he or she wants (obstacles). And the stronger the goals and \\nthe bigger the obstacles, the bigger the laughs. \\nExercise: Setting the Character\\'s Goal \\nWhal is the main goal of the character in your A-story? \\nWhat are the obstacles standing in the way of the character achieving \\nthat goal? \\nWhat are five additional obstacles thai come up when your character \\npursues his or her goal? \\n2. \\n3. \\n4. . \\n5. \\nBreak your story into the six beats I mentioned before: \\n1.

Resolve \\nDon\\'t worry about the details, just get the six major beats of your \\nstory £gn TALK with Chuck Adams, vice president, Simon ik Schuster \\n\\'The story arc is the key to virtually any successful story-based writing. \\nSo often I see really well written novels that don\\'t so much arc as they \\nhave a little burp, and it\\'s on to the resolution. Without the arc, the \\nviewer/reader loses interest. Relatability, story arc, and through line are \\nthe keys to successful storytelling of any kind.\" \\nLike stand-up jokes, sitcoms are highly structured pieces. One reason is \\nthat most of them (with the exception of commercial-free HBO and a few \\nother cable networks) have commercials. Sitcoms generally have a cliff-\\nhanger at the act break—before each commercial—where it looks as if the \\nhero is not going to achieve his goal. Theoretically, the viewer won\\'t change \\nthe channel because he wants to see how the hero is going to overcome the \\nobstacles and win in this seemingly losing situation. Conflict is what creates \\nthe momentum and leads to the obstacles and the cliffhanger. The escala\\xad\\ntion and subsequent resolution of this conflict creates the story arc. \\nThe story arc charts the amount of tension or conflict in the story. \\nThe characters start out in peace, and very quickly something happens \\nthat disrupts that peace. The character then has a goal. The arc climbs \\nhigher and higher as the hero\\'s attempts to achieve his goal are impeded \\nby obstacles. The chart returns to a low point as the conflict gets resolved. \\nWhen working out the six beats of your story, you want to make sure \\nthat your arc works—that all the elements in your story build to the res-\\noluiion. PRO TALK with Emily Levine, writer/producer \\n\"Every beat should be working toward building the arc by pushing ihe \\nconflict forward and then building toward the resolution. If you have \\nan extraneous beat that\\'s funny but does not serve the story—cut it. \\nThe biggest problem beginning writers have is they think, \\'What would \\nbe funny?\\' rather than, \\'What would make a good story?\\'\" \\nExercise: Story Arc \\nBreak your story into obstacles and chart a detailed story arc. \\n1. What is the shape of your arc? \\n2. Does it peak too soon? \\n3. Is there a point where there is no conflict? \\n4. Is there a point where the conflict is not heading toward resolution? \\n5. Is the conflict always escalating? \\nThe B-Story \\nSome sitcoms have just an A-story, but most sitcoms have a B-story and \\na few sitcoms have a C-story and even a D-story, such as IIBO\\'s Sex in the \\nCity, where all four characters each have their own story. The A-story is \\nthe main story of the sitcom and almost always involves your star. \\n\"How do you deal with ensemble shows like Friends that have more \\nthan one star?\" \\nIn these shows the A-story alternates between the characters each \\nweek. \\nAccording to producer/writer Emily Levine, the substories can serve \\nseveral different functions, depending on the sitcom. \\n• B-story fills out episode—In these situations the substories don\\'t connect \\nwith the A-story or one another. This is the least complex form of story\\xad\\ntelling. \\n• B-story counterpoints A-story—In these stories, what happens in one \\nstory affects the other. They dovetail at a certain point, or the payoff of one might depend on the payoff of the other. The relationship between \\nthe A- and B-stories is both funny and surprising. Seinfeld had A-, B-, C-, \\nand D-stories, which usually dovetailed, because the premise of Seinfeld \\ninvolved the coincidences in life. An example of this was the \"Chicken \\nRoaster\" episode. The inciting incident was that a Kenny Rogers Chicken \\nRoaster goes up across from Jerry\\'s building. In one story, Kramer \\nprotests trying to close the place down, while in another story ferry\\'s col\\xad\\nlege buddy gets fired and starts working at the Chicken Roaster. \\n• Theme-related substories—Some ensemble shows have all the substories \\nbased on the same theme. For instance, in Sex in the City there is one \\ntheme and each of the four characters\\' stories illuminates an aspect of \\nthat theme. The star, Sarah Jessica Parker, always has the A-story, while \\nthe other three characters are in the B-, C-, and D-stories. For instance, \\nin one episode the theme was \"relationship deal breakers.\" Each substory \\nhad a character trying to answer the question \"When do you stay with \\nthe person and compromise, and when do you dump him?\" \\nExercise: Substories \\n1. Review your preparation research on your sitcom and find out whether \\nthe structure of your sitcom includes substories. \\n2. What is the relationship of the substory (or stories) to the A-story? \\n3. Pick another log line for your B-story (and if necessary, C-story) and \\nbreak it into goal, obstacles, and six beats. \\n• What are the goals of your characters in your B-story (stories)? \\n• What are the main obstacles standing in the way of your character \\nachieving his or her goal? \\n• What are five additional obstacles that come up when your character \\ngoes for his or her goal? \\n2. \\n3. \\n4. • Six beats of your substories: \\nI. \\n2. \\n3. \\n4. \\n5. \\n6. \\nChart a story arc for all of your substories. \\nWhether you arc writing a spec script or writing on staff, everyone writes a \\nstory outline before writing the actual script. This outline is a very detailed \\n\"what happens where,\" scene-by-scene description of the story, which may \\neven include snippets of dialogue. \\nHere is a sample—an outline of a produced episode of Everybody Loves \\nRaymond, written by co-executive producer Cindy Chupack. \\nEVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND [outline] \\n\"What\\'s With Robert?\" \\nby Cindy Chupack \\nWhen Robert and Amy break up again the family starts to wonder if he might \\nbe gay. \\nTEASER—INT RAY AND DEBRA\\'S KITCHEN—DAY (I) \\nAmy is crying to Debra about the fact that she and Robert broke up again. \\nlie\\'s still not sure she\\'s \"the one,\" and he is not sure what he wants blah blah \\nblah. It\\'s the same old thing. I le\\'s never going to marry her, and she has \\nnobody to blame but herself. She\\'s always falling for the wrong guys. 1 his is \\nher pattern. Debra reminds her that her pattern before Robert was to be \\nattracted to gay men. so at least Robert wasn\\'t that. \"As far as we know.\" Amy \\nsays. Debra laughs, but Amy is half serious. She never really considered it \\nbefore, but maybe Robert could be gay. Ann-: \"Think about it. He likes sho* \\ntunes, he can dance, he has a good sense of style, he didn\\'t pressure me for a \\nyear when I didn\\'t want to sleep with him, and he\\'s very attached to hi8 \\nmother.\" Debra isn\\'t ready to accept this theory. She points out that Robert \\n/ Las married and he seems to like women. Amy: \"Sure, he started out straight. \\ngut I\\'m the spatula. 1 turn them.\" \\nSCENE A—INT. RAY AND DEBRAS BEDROOM—NIGHT (I) \\nRay was hoping to get lucky, but Debra\\'s not in the mood. She\\'s sad that \\nRobert and Amy broke up, and she feels kind of responsible since she intro\\xad\\nduced them. This was a couple childbearing years off Amy\\'s life, and it seems \\nlike Robert is never going to get it together to marry anyone. Ray: \"Poor \\nRobert. He\\'ll never have a wife and kids. For the rest of his life he\\'ll just have \\nto go on date after date, looking for love with strangers.\" Debra doesn\\'t \\nappreciate Ray\\'s jealous tone. Ray tries to cover by actually taking part in the \\nconversation: \"Why did they break up?\" Debra: \"I don\\'t know. I think Robert \\nhas a fear of commitment.\" Ray: \"Is that what Amy said?\" Debra: \"No, she \\nthinks Robert\\'s gay.\" Ray finds it amusing that women assume a guy is gay \\njust because the guy rejected them. Debra rejects Ray all the time, and he \\ndoesn\\'t call her a lesbian . . . every single time. Debra forces Ray to think for \\na minute—is it possible Robert might be gay? Ray is annoyed by the ques\\xad\\ntion. Robert obviously likes women. Why are they even talking about this? \\nDebra: \"Maybe he\\'s gay and he doesn\\'t know it yet.\" Ray: \"I think that\\'s \\nsomething you know.\" Debra makes the case that some men can\\'t face the \\npossibility that they are gay because it would be too devastating to their fam\\xad\\nilies, so they never deal with it. and they end up alone and unhappy their \\nwhole lives. Wouldn\\'t that be sad if that were the case with Robert? Ray: \\n\"Wouldn\\'t it be sadder if he ends up with a closet full of leather chaps?\" \\nDebra is pissed at Rav for being so closed-minded, and his stupid comment \\nproves her point that if Robert were gay, the Barone family would not be very \\nsympathetic or supportive. \\nSCENE B—INT MARIE AND FRANK\\'S KITCHEN—DAY (2) \\nRay stops by Frank and Marie\\'s to borrow something, but while he\\'s there he \\nstarts to wonder if Debra might be right about his family. Are they too judg\\xad\\nmental to accept alternative lifestyles? He asks Frank and Marie how would \\nthey react if someone they knew were gay. Frank doesn\\'t want to hear this \\nkind of talk while he\\'s eating. Rav says he\\'s just curious. Could they ileal with \\n\"•\\' Marie says of course. Her second cousin Freda is a lesbian. Frank never \\nknew this. They get sidetracked with talk of Freda. Then Ray asks how they \\nWould feel if one of their sons were gay. Frank: \"Holy crap! I knew it. Marie, \\ndidn\\'t I tell you there was something funny about Michael?\" After a frustrat-\\nlr>g moment of defending Michael\\'s masculinity, Ray finally blurts out that he \\nWasn\\'t talking about Michael. He was talking about Robert. Marie and Frank arc stunned. Marie: \"Robert\\'s not gay. He\\'s a policeman.\" Frank: \"One of \\nthose Village People was a policeman.\" Ray tries to explain that Robert isn\\'t \\ngay, he was just wondering how they would feel if he was, but Marie and \\nFrank are already arguing about their gay son. Ray gels a glimpse of What it \\nwould be like to come out to his parents, and it\\'s not verv pleasant. Frank is \\nhorrified and completely ill-equipped to handle this, and Marie is surpris\\xad\\ningly fine, saying that \"the gays love their mothers.\" Before Ray can set the \\nrecord straight (so to speak), Robert enters. Robert: \"Hi, everybody.\" Marie \\nhugs him and says, \"It\\'s fine with me if you\\'re gay, dear.\" \\nEND OF ACT ONE \\nExercise: Writing an Outline \\nNow that, you have the six major beats of your stories (A-story, B-story, \\nand so forth) worked out, combine the stories and detail each one of \\nthem by writing a small paragraph about what happens and where it hap\\xad\\npens. \\nAs Ellen Sandler suggests, \"Figure out the best location for each scene \\nto take place. Remember, you are limited. It is not a movie where they go \\naway on location.\" \\nIf you are writing with a partner, the best way to work on a story is to \\nuse a tape recorder. Sitcom writing team Rob Lotterstcin and Ellen Idel-\\nson (Grosse Pointe, Will and Grace, Ellen, Suddenly Susan) tape-record ses\\xad\\nsions where they talk about the scene and improvise the different roles. \\n\"Only when we have acted out the whole story do we turn on the corn-\\npater and transpose what made us laugh. That way you get natural dia\\xad\\nlogue—the way people really talk. If you just sit down at the computer, \\nyour dialogue can sound literary and stilted.\" Meaning—not funny. \\nWjitcom Day 8: Detailing Your Outline \\nBy now you\\'re probably chomping on the bit, ready to write your sitcom. \\nbut not yet. If your outline doesn\\'t work, your script won\\'t work. Better \\nto find the mistakes now and save yourself time later. \\nExercise: Making Your Outline Work \\nCompare your story outline with what you learned from dissecting the \\nshow in terms of numbers of scenes, theme of the story, locations, \\n/ you can. Ir\"s not necessarily going to be good, funny, or tight, but this \\nburn draft will lay the foundation for future drafts. \\nExercise: Picture It \\nWhat the characters say and do, and how they react, must be extremely \\nauthentic: everything said must be in character. As in stand-up, if you \\nwrite to be funny, you might sacrifice the authenticity and wind up with \\na script that loses the reader\\'s interest on the first page. \\nRelax, close your eyes, and imagine the room in which you place your \\ncharacters in the first scene. Somebody is doing something. What are \\nthey doing? What do they say? How does the other character react to \\nthis? What do they say? \\nGo through the entire story imagining the interplay between the \\ncharacters—essentially, watch the show. Then open your eyes and write \\nthe entire script. Go for the realism first—in the next draft you can go for \\nthe funny. It\\'s more important now to make sure the story works and is \\nbelievable; you can punch it up later. \\nThen talk the script out into a tape recorder, acting out all the parts. \\nEven if something isn\\'t working, don\\'t stop. \\nWrite out die entire script. It\\'s not important how many pages it is \\nright now; just get the story out. If you don\\'t have a joke where you want \\none, don\\'t stop—just put something there as a \"holding place\" and keep \\ngoing until the whole story is on paper. \\nFor the next three days you are going to concentrate on the story struc\\xad\\nture. Anv working writer will tell you that the key to good writing is \\nrewriting. What often keeps a script from becoming great is that the \\nwriter is married to things that arc just OK. Just as in writing stand-up. \\nyou must be willing to dump not only the things that don\\'t work but also \\nthe things that are just adequate. Adequate won\\'t get you a job. Only bril\\xad\\nliance will. \\nIf you truly want to be a working writer, you need to view your work \\nwith the same critical eye as a professional. That means cut out every\\xad\\nthing in your story that is phony, unreal, inauthentic. or hack (done \\nbefore). Exercise: Cutting Out What Doesn\\'t Work \\n, Cut anything that is unaulhentic or unreal, even if it is hilarious. It will \\nbreak the reality of your storv and distance the viewer (and the reader) \\nfrom the story. \\nB If a scene is not about a main character (A-story) or a secondary charac\\xad\\nter (B-story) striving for their goal, cut it. \\n, Is the story interesting? If the turns are predictable, then change them to \\nsomething that is a surprise. \\nIn a comedy, il anything can go wrong, it will. Robert McKee, writing \\nteacher and author of Stoij: Substance, Structure, Style, anil the Principles of \\nSa-ecnwiting, refers to this as the comedy gap—the gap between what is sup\\xad\\nposed to happen and what actually happens. For instance, in real life you \\nwalk up to your front door, put in a key, open it, and enter. In a comedy, \\nyou trip on the way to the door, hit your head on the doorknob, and then \\nthe doorknob comes off when you turn it. You reach into a pocket to get \\nyour keys, they get stuck in your pants. When you finally do yank them \\nout. you rip your pants. Then the key gets stuck in the lock and, as you \\npull the door open, it comes off its hinges and knocks you over. \\nExercise: Heightening the Obstacles \\nLook through your story and make it even harder for your characters to \\nachieve their goals by putting more obstacles in the way or by heighten\\xad\\ning the obstacles already there. For example, in my \"vacationship\" story \\nRaymond\\'s wife wants his attention at the exact tiirtc when his mother\\'s \\ncar breaks down. To heighten the obstacles, maybe the car doesn\\'t break \\ndown in her driveway so that she needs a ride to the supermarket, but \\ninstead breaks down in the middle of rush-hour traffic and causes such a \\nhuge traffic jam that it\\'s on the TV news. And instead of Raymond miss-\\n•ng just an ordinary dinner with his wile, Debra, it could be he misses a \\ndinner she spent hours preparing to celebrate the anniversary of the first \\ntime thev said, \"I love vou,\" to each other. PRO TALK with John Truby, writing coach/story consultant \\n\"The first thing a writer of a spec script has to do is analyze the setup \\nof the show itself. Incredibly, most writers skimp on this step. They \\npay have watched the show many times and think they know it. In \\nfact, they have probably missed the keys to the show.\" \\nSpend one more day matching up the structure of your spec script to \\nthe structure of the produced scripts o( the show. Go back to your prep \\nwork and make sure that your script follows the format of the show. \\nDepending on the sitcom you\\'re writing, the straight person gives the \\nsetup to a joke in dialogue and the funny person gives the retort. This is \\nlike in stand-up act-out, when one person says something and the other \\none reacts. Make sure the characters\\' lines are in reaction to each other or \\nthe situation, not just \"funny\" things. They have to be real. \\nExercise: Punch-up \\nPut an asterisk next to every joke on the page. Then find five other possi\\xad\\nbilities for each joke. This is good practice even if you think that every \\njoke is a laugh riot. If you do get a job writing sitcoms, you\\'ll find that \\nyour opinion of what is funny doesn\\'t count for much. It\\'s what the pro\\xad\\nducers, the stars, and the suits at the network think is funny that is \\nimportant. Typically sitcom writers have to come up with new jokes at a \\nmoment\\'s notice. Go back to the \"mind mapping\" stand-up exercise \\n(page 183) to work out different retorts. Now\\n  that you made your funny jokes funnier, look at the straight lines in \\nyour script and turn those into jokes. For instance, instead of saying, \"My \\nfather is an alcoholic.\" try \"Let\\'s just say that my father\\'s best friend was \\nJim—Jim Beam.\" \\nNot every line can be a joke, but you can punch up even the straightest of \\nlines doing what the pros call adding color. That means saying something \\nI in a clever way rather than a straightforward one. So, instead of, \"Where \\nwere vou? Getting a manicure?\" your character would say, \"Where were \\nyou? Getting those claws filed?\" Adding color is an offbeat way of saying \\nthe same thing. \\n1 \\nOne of the most painful but most helpful ways to find out what works \\nand what doesn\\'t work in your script is to have strangers read it out loud. \\nArrange a read-through with friends, or better yet, ask your local college \\nor high school drama department if some of the students would do a \\nread-through. Give the actors the script in advance so they have time to \\nprepare. Be sure to tape-record the reading because you will probably be \\ntoo nervous during the reading to remember what worked and didn\\'t \\nwork. Plus, a comment or suggestion that slipped by you or that you dis\\xad\\nmissed at the time could be enormously helpful later. Listening to your \\nwork will give you a perspective on the flow, timing, dialogue, characters, \\nami humor that reading it won\\'t. Then ask the actors and listeners for \\nfeedback: \\n• Was there anything awkward or that didn\\'t flow? \\n• Was there anything that felt unreal? \\n• Was there any time that the script became boring? \\n• Was there anything thai really didn\\'t work? And don\\'t defend your writing, no matter what comments people \\nmake. Just write everything down and review it the next day. There are \\nalways some people whose comments are totally worthless and who are \\njust there to pee on your project. Still, don\\'t defend yourself. Just keep \\nthe comments that make sense to you and toss the rest. From this process \\nyou will have a good idea of what flaws are in your script. \\n(lather up all your notes and the comments you\\'ve received. It\\'s time to \\nfix all the flaws and polish all the rough edges. If you did all the prep and \\nstory structure work, there\\'s a good chance the basic structure of vour \\nscript is solid. But if you didn\\'t take the time to lay the groundwork, this \\nis when you\\'ll pay the price. It doesn\\'t matter how funny your jokes are, \\nbecause if there is a problem with the story, or the story doesn\\'t fit that \\nparticular show or those characters, your script isn\\'t going to fiv and you \\nwill have to start over again. \\n\"What do I do if the basic story is OK but I have one or two problems \\nI don\\'t know how to fix?\" \\nTurn to your characters for help. Write a dialogue with the main \\ncharacter, or the character involved in your problem area, and ask her or \\nhim what to do. Be direct and to the point and, most important, don\\'t \\nthink about or edit the character\\'s response. Write down the first tiling \\nthat comes to mind and continue the conversation until you get your \\nsolution. \\nLet\\'s say that after doing the read-through, 1 discovered that my idea \\nof having Debra make a dinner celebrating the anniversary of the first \\ntime they said, \"I love you,\" didn\\'t work, but I didn\\'t know why or whai \\nto replace it with. The dialogue I would write out with Debra might go \\nsomething like this: \\nJUDY: Why isn\\'t this anniversary of when you first said, \"I love you.\" i° \\neach other working? \\nDEBRA: Because the first time the L-word was said was a disaster. I said it \\nto Ray, and Ray freaked out. and then I freaked out because he \\nfreaked out, and believe me, it wasn\\'t anything to celebrate. fojDY: OK, so what would be an anniversary worth celebrating in your rela\\xad\\ntionship? \\nDtliRA: Our first big fight. We had been going out for almost a year. I \\ndon\\'t even remember what the fight was about—it was something \\nsmall and stupid thai escalated into something big and stupid. And \\nwe were yelling at each other and all of a sudden Ray stopped and \\nsaid. \"Honey, this is our first fight.\" And we just stopped fighting, just \\nlike that, and started kissing, and, well, never mind what happened \\nafter that. But that\\'s when I knew that I really loved him. \\nHaving Debra prepare a special surprise dinner to celebrate the \\nanniversary of their first fight is a great setup for the fight that occurs \\nwhen Raymond misses the dinner to help his mom. Which sets up a call\\xad\\nback—Raymond tries to assuage Debra (once she tells him what anniver\\xad\\nsary she is celebrating) by saying, \"Look, honey, this is our one millionth \\nfight,\" which of course doesn\\'t have the same impact as when he said it \\nthe first time. In fact, it makes her feel worse because they have fought a \\nmillion times, which is very unromantic, and makes her think that maybe \\nthey\\'re not compatible like Fred and Suzanne. \\nSo if you have a script problem that you can\\'t solve, put those char\\xad\\nacters to work and let them solve it for you! \\nNow that vour script is in the best shape that you can make it, it\\'s time to \\nhave a professional read it and give you notes. And the emphasis here is \\non professional. Just because your cousin Bubba watches a lot of TV \\ndoesn\\'t mean that he is a qualified professional. \\nWho does fit in that category? \\n• A working writer or producer who works on sitcoms. If you do a little \\nresearch and really put your mind to it, you will probably find that you \\nare two degrees or less from a working sitcom writer or producer. Scan \\nyour family tree for someone who dated someone who is a lormer e\\\\ ot \\nsomeone who now is working on some show. Make that call and ask \\nthem if they would read your script in order to help you become a better \\nwriter. At this point, you are not submitting the script for a job; you\\'re \\njust looking to become a better writer.

Or pick a topic that interests you and find your point of view bv \\nlisting at least ten opinions about it. \\nPRO TALK witit Sybil Adelman Sap, writer \\n\"The philosophy and the point of the piece should be compatible with \\nthe publication. Child magazine is an upscale publication and you \\nwouldn\\'t write an article for them on the allures of being childless, or \\nhow to buy hand-me-downs, because you need to keep in mind the \\naudience. I wrote a funny article for them about finding a nanny. The \\nslant was that we mothers will do anything to keep a good nanny. We\\'re \\nsucking up to the nanny—the nanny drives whatever car she wants, the \\nnanny gets the good steak, you get the leftovers.\" \\n• Choose a stand-up premise or an interesting opinion that fits the tone of \\nthe magazine and write your thoughts on it as if you were writing a letter \\nto a close friend. For instance, if vour premise was \"It\\'s weird that the \\nsame people who are against abortion are for the death penalty,\" that \\npremise would work with a liberal magazine such as Mother I ones but not \\nso well with Parenting magazine. \\n• When writing, outline your article in bullet points first. Each bullet point \\nshould substantiate an aspect of vour point of view. As in writing a sit\\xad\\ncom, the more detail you can put into the outline, the easier it will be to \\nwrite the article. \\n• Do a burn draft of your article—using your outline as a map, write the \\nentire article in one sitting as fast as you can. \\nThe above will get you started and give you something to work with. \\nBut any professional can tell you (hat writing is about rewriting. The \\nnext part is the hard part—punch-up, polish, and tune. Look back to the \\ndetails on writing a sitcom. First make sure that the structure works and \\nthat there is a logical flow of ideas. Next, make it funny. Then make it \\nfunnier.

Motivational speaking is 70 percent entertainment and 30 \\npercent message—sort of a funny sermon. \\nCrafting a successful speech is a trial-and-error process. My one-hour \\ntalk took four years to put together. 1 started out volunteering to speak \\nfor nonprofit organizations. At first 1 was so bad that some of these \\norganizations should have paid me not to speak. Here are some basic tips \\nto assist you in putting together your talk: \\n• Find a topic on which you are an expert, or at least think that you are an \\nexpert. This is not necessarily something that you went to school to \\nlearn, but rather a topic about which your life experiences have made you \\nan authority, fust as you picked serious topics in your stand-up act to \\njoke about, these topics should be serious as well. To find a topic, listen \\nto what kind of advice you give your friends. How much of it actually \\nworks? Make a list of these topics. \\n»• Do not sacrifice your message for a joke; it will diminish the power of \\nyour talk. When putting together your talk, go for the message first— \\nthen add the humor as an aside. Look at it this way—you\\'re a funny per\\xad\\nson giving a serious speech. \\n• Always start your talk the same way you would start your stand-up act, \\nby connecting with the audience. Connect with them by being personal \\nand authentic right off the bat and zoning in on where they\\'re at. 1 once \\nmade the mistake of trying to wake up a dead crowd by starting with a \\nton of energy. It had the opposite effect. Rather then riling them up, it \\noverwhelmed them and pushed them away. \\n• Tell them up front exactly what your talk is all about and then go for the \\nhumor. To avoid the \"Who the hell are you?\" look, be very straightfor\\xad\\nward in your opening. Tell them who you are and what you are going to \\ntalk about, and then let the humor be a surprise. \\n• Never put down anything about anyone in the room. I made that mis-\\nItake once, big time. I did a talk for an accounting firm, but before I spoke \\nthey showed this extremely long and boring home movie. So 1 opened \\nwith a joke about how long and boring the film was, not realizing that it \\nwas the CEO\\'s home movie. Lesson one—never make a joke about the \\nperson who signs your check.

Step 1: Get good. \\nStep 2: Get noticed. \\nStep 3: Get paid. \\nThe way to become successful isn\\'t a big mystery. The comedy busi\\xad\\nness works just like every other business: Get good—develop a good prod\\xad\\nuct. Get noticed—advertise it. Get paid—duh. But many novices seem \\noblivious to this rather obvious 1-2-3 approach. They forget that timing, \\nlike everything else in comedy, is the key. Putting yourself out in the mar\\xad\\nketplace before you\\'re ready not only can hurt your career, it can even \\nprevent you from ever having one. The good news is, everyone gets at \\nleast one shot. Someone important will read your script, see your act, or \\nhear your pitch. The bad news is, someone important will read your \\nscript, see your act, or hear your pitch.

It didn\\'t matter if I got a standing ovation, had a great \\nwriting day, or even pulled in some big bucks doing comedy—1 wasn\\'t a \\nhousehold name. It took me a long time to realize that success is a state \\nof mind. My critical voice that nagged, \"But you don\\'t have a sitcom,\" \\nquieted down as I started focusing on small triumphs—like finding a \\ngreat premise, writing new material, having a great set.

If you have followed \\nthe exercises in this book, by this time you might have performed a stand-\\nup act, written a spec script, put together a one-person show, or perhaps \\njust thought about writing a humorous essay. Maybe you started off read\\xad\\ning this book wanting to write sitcoms, but later realized that writing \\njokes for other comics is more your thing. It doesn\\'t matter what you \\nchose to do, only that you love doing it. Whatever field of comedy you \\nchoose, ask yourself these questions: \\n1. Is this something that I would be happy doing ten hours a day, every \\nday? \\n2. Could 1 do it for five years without making money and not give up? \\n3. Repeat question #2 and be honest. \\nWhat two fields of comedy appeal the most to you? \\n1. \\n2. \\nExercise: Writing Your Future \\nIn order to get where you want to go, you need to know where you\\'re \\ngoing.

Nowadays, however, an agent will only sign someone who has \\nat least an hour of killer material, two killer spec scripts, and a lot of proj\\xad\\nects on the front burner. \\nNotice I don\\'t say \"material\" or \"scripts.\" You must have brilliantly \\nfunny killer material and killer scripts. Unfortunately, most comics and \\ncomedv writers don\\'t create top-notch material in the first couple of \\nyears. I cringe when I look at what I did onstage during my first four \\nyears. It\\'s not that it wasn\\'t good or funny, it\\'s just that it takes a lot of \\ntrial and error to come up with original material that truly reflects your \\nvision and your voice and that reflects your persona. \\nAccumulating killer material can be an aggravating game of catch-tip \\nbecause even your best material will get old—fast. As soon as you say, \\n\"What\\'s up with that Republican president?\"—there\\'s a Democrat in the \\nWhite House. That funny TV commercial you like to parody is off the \\nair, and suddenly the celebrity that you trashed for five minutes\\' worth of \\nyucks is dead. Yesterday\\'s hip is today\\'s hack. Your Golden Girh spec \\nscript might be brilliant, but it isn\\'t going to get you work today. You have \\nto work on new material and new scripts every day. \\nExercise: Keeping Current \\n• Make a regular time to work on your material. Rumor has it that Jerry \\nSeinfeld set a timer and wrote until it rang. \\n• Be willing to throw out material—even if it kills. If you get a chunk that \\nkills and you do it at every show, soon you will depend on that piece. You \\nmay even become frightened to perform without it. lake a courageous \\nstep and toss it out for a few months, to make room for another piece to \\nadd to your stockpile of killer material. \\n• Go through this book again and again, because each time that you read it \\nyou\\'ll be at a different level of skill, and there\\'s a good chance you\\'ll get \\nsomething new out of it each time. \\n• Write even if vou don\\'t feel like writing. Sometimes the darkest of moods \\nwill yield the freshest material. What vou write might not end up in your \\nact or a sitcom script, but you might be on your way to a great New )fork \\nmagazine piece, \"50 Reasons to Go on Prozac.\" ^91 * y hether you want to write comedy or perform it, getting good is a \\nVv daily challenge, and you have to work al it all the time. It\\'s not \\nsomething you do when \\\\oufeel creative. It\\'s something von do no matter \\nwhat, even when you\\'re too busy, too tired, or too burnt out from your \\nday job. Yon even do it when you\\'re recovering from plastic surgery. \\nWhy? Because that\\'s what it takes to get good. \\nRemember—every day that you don\\'t work on your act or your \\nscript, some eager beaver is getting that much further ahead of you. The \\nreal competition comes in the everyday chore of working to get better at \\nyour craft. So when you are thinking about skipping a writing session, an \\nopen mike, or a workshop class, think of that comic out there who is \\nshowing up—prepared and sober. \\nImagine this. You finally get an agent to come see your act or read your \\nscript, and guess what? He liked it! You\\'re in heaven, until you hear the \\nscariest words in showbiz: \"So, what else do you ha\\\\re?\" \\nTV eats up material quickly. The good news is, there\\'s a big and con\\xad\\nstant demand for funny stuff. The bad news—if you don\\'t have a stock-PRO TALK with Christopher Titus \\n\"My real success happened when 1 started talking about the dark side \\nof my life—my mom trying to commit suicide, my dad\\'s drinking. \\nWhat made a total difference in my career was when I stopped trying \\nto be funny and started being OK with exposing my reality—but all \\ndone in a funny way.\" \\nPRO TALK with Richard Lams \\n\"Don\\'t perform in high-profile clubs too soon. Work on your craft in \\nplaces you won\\'t be judged too harshly. Stick with nice people—the \\nmovers and shakers who have been successful won\\'t be threatened and \\narc capable of giving you advice rather than just judging you.\" \\nStop whining about how bad open mikes are. Open mikes are comedy \\nboot camps—the worse they are, the more seasoned you become. To get \\ncertified as a scuba diver, I went through a program that simulated every \\npossible thing that could go wrong—losing my mask, losing my way, and \\neven losing my air supply. Open mikes are the place where everything does \\ngo wrong. The mikes go dead, the audience is dead, and vou die. That -\\nOK. Better you learn how to deal with these bad situations at Comedy \\nNight at Lou\\'s Lobster House than during audition night at the Comedy \\nStore. Because when you finally get that big agent to come see vou per\\xadform, there\\'s no guarantee that the audience won\\'t be small, sleepy, or \\nstupid. So do yourself a favor and start small. Hey. Rosie O\\'Donnell got \\nher stan doing stand-up in bowling alleys and Hamburger Hamlets. \\nCreate Your Own Open Mikes \\nNot enough open mikes in your neighborhood? Hey, you\\'re creative—start \\nyour own. One of my classes started their own comedy club at a hotel near \\nthe airport. They figured that the hotel bar had a built-in audience since \\npeople were stuck there. They worked out a deal with the hotel and \\ncharged a cover. Not only did they get paid, but other comics started call-\\ning them and suddenly they went from auditioning for spots to booking \\nother comics. One tip—never do it on a sports night. Businessmen can \\nturn ugh when someone turns off their game so the comics can perform. \\nPRO TALK with Katliy Griffen \\n\"You have to promote yourself. I would rent a theater with a few other \\ncomics—Jeanane Garofalo, Dana Carvey—and we charged people one \\ndollar.

As more stand-ups became available on TV, audiences \\ndried up and clubs closed. Now it\\'s almost easier to get a ride on Air Force \\nOne than it is to get a spot in the lop clubs in Los Angeles and New York. \\nI asked owner Chris Mazzilli and former talent coordinator Delilah \\nRomos of New York City\\'s Gotham Comedy Club hov\\\\ to get a spot and \\nhow to make il pay off. \\n\"What\\'s the best way for a comic to make a good impression on a club \\nowner?\" \\nThere is no book, course, or formula that can teach you how to be a sea\\xad\\nsoned performer. As the Nike ad says, \"Just do it.\" Comics with smart \\nmaterial but amateurish stage presence are called writers. If you want to \\nbe successful as a comic, get onstage, on any stage, as much as you can. \\n\"But open mikes suck.\" CHRIS: Don\\'t go over the light when you audition. That drives roe out of \\nmy mind. \\nDELILAH: Even if you\\'re doing well—when the light comes on, get off the \\nstage. It\\'s a business and there are time constraints. When you are \\ngetting a lot of laughter and you see the light, say, \"Thank vou, good \\nnight my name is . . . ,\" and run. \\n\"Anything else a comic should know to get on your good side?\" \\nDELILAH: Stay out of the way of the waitresses and be nice to them \\nWhen you are self-absorbed you can come across as rude, and if they \\nthink you\\'re rude, it will backfire when the manager or owner asks \\nthem who did well that night. Also . . . \\nUnderstand that there is a flow going on. Sometimes a comic has \\nnervous energy and doesn\\'t mean to, but gets in the way. When we do \\ntwo shows a night, we have to reset the entire room and start a sec\\xad\\nond show, so it helps when the comics keep out of the way. Introduce \\nyourself to the manager and ask where he likes the comics to hang \\nout so you don\\'t get in the way \\nEverybody likes harmony, so don\\'t get cocky with the other \\ncomics. By to be cordial and foster a sense of camaraderie. \\nWhen you call for feedback or booking info, leave your name and \\nyour phone number twice. \\n\"What do you look for when you book a comic?\" \\nGiRlS: I look for the smarter comic, the one with original autobiographi\\xad\\ncal material. These people are unique—their history, who they are, \\nwhere they come from. \\nDELILAH: Find your own voice and don\\'t be elicited. Do your homework— \\nspend five hours a week watching comedy at clubs so that you learn \\nwho does what kind of material and which kind of material is over\\xad\\ndone. Stereotypical jokes are just hacky. As a comic finds her own \\nvoice she gradually builds her own persona, and out of that grows \\ngenuine originality \\n\"Wliat about language?\" \\nDELILAH: Every club has its own character. Chris wants elegant upscale \\nmaterial. He doesn\\'t want really blue jokes. Your language should be \\nappropriate for your audience. \"What should a comic do to get hooked into your club?\" \\nCHRIS: Send in a tape—that\\'s (lie step. It\\'s rare that somebody who has \\nonly been doing comedy for one or two years gets booked. But there \\nare those occasions when you see someone who is so good that you \\ngo, \"They have it.\" I\\'d say it usually takes about five or six years lo \\nbecome a good comic. A professional comic can do well consistently \\nin any kind of room, whereas a newer person who has a good ten to \\nfifteen minutes can get thrown by something like a bad crowd. It \\ndoesn\\'t make a difference what\\'s going on in the room to the pros, \\nthey are that confident. \\nDELILAH: It\\'s a long process. We don\\'t hook people with less than five \\nyears\\' experience, because we want polished acts. In New York there \\nare a lot of venues where you can work out your material—in dough\\xad\\nnut shops, coffee shops, and supermarkets. Beginning comics should \\nhang out at the club, meet as many people as they can, try to get a \\ngood recommendation, and persevere. \\n\"Does having an agent help?\" \\nDELILAH: The proof is in the pudding. If someone has an agent but isn\\'t \\nready, that agent isn\\'t going to be able to help them. \\ni \\nYou need to know what other comics and comedy writers are doing, and \\nnot just to prevent duplication. You must study the past and the present \\nin oider to find the wave of the future. Rent videos, read scripts, watch \\n1 V, hang out at clubs, go to festivals, and subscribe to Variety. \\nOnce you work on something for more than five minutes you lose your \\nperspective on it and need a fresh eye. Although writers, directors, impro-\\nVIHTS, and actors are always trying to improve their craft by taking \\nclasses, most stand-up comics seem to have an \"I\\'m in this alone and don\\'t need anybody\\'s help\" sort of attitude. However, most successful \\nentertainers have a long list of classes, mentors, and comedy buddies who \\nprovided roadside assistance on their path to fame and fortune. \\n\"But you can\\'t teach anyone how to be funny, can you?\" \\nNo one can teach you how to be funny or talented, but if you are tal\\xad\\nented and funny, a professional you respect can help you develop your \\nskills. And no matter how talented and funny you are, if you don\\'t spend \\nyour waking hours asking, \"How can I improve my craft?\" chances are \\nyou will spend the rest of your life asking, \"Would you like to hear our \\nspecials today?\" \\nGet a Mentor \\nA mentor is someone who can give you feedback and point you in the \\nright direction. Sucking up to people will get you everywhere in this busi\\xad\\nness—especially if it\\'s authentic. Contact and cultivate professionals who \\nthink like you but are higher up on the food chain. Seek them out. Buy \\nthem lunch. They\\'ll admire your spunk, relive their own green-behind-\\nthe-ears days through you, and get a kick out of being a mentor. \\nHow to Set a Mentor \\nWHters—get to know someone on a show by noting who wrote the \\nepisodes you liked and then c-mailing her or him a fan letter. Introduce \\nyourself as a new writer and tell her specifically what you liked about her \\nwriting. Do not ask her to do something for you.

Comics who can\\'t create their \\nown material are called actors. Once you become successful and have an \\nidentifiable persona, only then can people write for you. But the very \\nnature of being a comic means that you have a burning desire to talk to \\nan audience about something. No one can tell you what that something is \\nand write it for you. Others can help you uncover it, add to it, and punch \\nit up, but ultimately you are the one who has to have the ideas. \\nWhere to find help: \\n• Writers can hire professional script readers to write coverage of their script. \\nThis is a detailed synopsis and opinion of your story.

The point of PR is making sure \\nthe right people notice you. There is certainly a glut of stand-up comics \\nand comedy writers out there, but very few are truly excellent. In my gen\\xad\\neration of comics the great ones were, to name a few, Robin Williams, l;1.v Lcno. ferry Seinfeld, Billy Crystal, Andy Kaufman, and Albert Brooks. \\nThey were the comic\\'s comics. Watching their sets at the Improv was \\nmore important than cruising the bar for dates—that\\'s how good they \\nwere. This was before the L.A. Improv was the breeding ground for TV \\ndevelopment deals. Back then, comics followed their gut instincts rather \\nthan their agents\\' advice. I remember one night in 1975 when Albert \\nBrooks took to the Improv stage at 11 P.M. and didn\\'t get off until 3 A.M. \\nA decade later, I still remember his premises—\"Hey, you know how \\ncomics just do material that everyone can relate to? What if comics did \\nmaterial that no one could relate to? OK, you know how it\\'s New Year\\'s \\nEve and you are stuck in an elevator? Right?\" He was a brilliant comic. \\nBut until you are at the brilliant stage, there are ways to stand out \\nfrom the pack while you are honing your craft. \\nLctterman is a brand. So is Seinfeld. Everyone knows what kind of com\\xad\\nedy they represent, and that brand of comedy is reflected in their mate\\xad\\nrial, clothes, and publicity. What is your brand of comedy? Whether you \\nare a comedy writer or a stand-up, in order to stand out it is essential that \\nyou distinguish yourself by magnifying your brand of comedy—your \\nidentity, your image, your persona. It\\'s not a cerebral decision you make \\nabout yourself. It\\'s who you are—exaggerated times ten. \\nRichard Lewis created a readily identifiable persona of \"angst\" by \\nwearing black, pacing the stage like a caged animal, and basing his jokes \\non his tortured life. Everything about him says, \"I\\'m sick, I\\'m mentally \\ndisturbed, and I\\'m in a terrible state.\" He has a persona and that\\'s his \\nwhole stance. \\nIs this a character he made up? No. In my interview with Richard, \\nH became apparent that his persona is just an exaggerated version of who \\nhe is. PRO TAIK ivith Richard Lewis \\n\"The only way I eould feel better was to make light of my low self-\\nesteem, self-loathing, chronic anxiety, and bouts of depression. Once I \\ngot laughs for that, I felt less alone, depression was lifted from me, and \\nit made me feel better. Stand-up is a legal drug.\" \\nKathy Griffon jokes about her abundant sex life: \"Everything I do is \\nall true and it\\'s just my take on a situation.\" Kathy also highlights her \\npersona by wearing tight, skimpy outfits that she practically pulls off \\nwhile she does her act. \\nbinding your persona is a trial-and-error process. Phyllis Diller \\nevolved her persona overyears. When she first started out she looked like \\nthe woman next door. She told me, \"That is what most of the female \\ncomics look like now. I realized that if I\\'m going to be onstage and \\nthey\\'ve got to pay to look at me, I better not look like the girl next door \\n\\'cause you can look at her for nothing.\" \\nMs. Diller then took her dark hair and made it peroxide white. She \\nstarted wearing shapeless dresses because \"1 wanted to tell them I was Hat \\nand I wasn\\'t. I had a 38C. I have a million jokes about being flat—\\'For \\nyears I wore foam rubber and then one day I thought, maybe I erased \\nthem.\\' You can\\'t do all those gags if they\\'re looking at boobs.\" \\nShe constructed her look wearing teeny little boots because she \\nwanted them to cul her leg at the exact skinniest point on her ankle. In \\nother words, \"I wanted to have a lot of skinny-leg jokes. \\'The last time I \\nsaw a leg like that there was a message attached.\\' \\'Colonel Sanders loved \\nmy legs; in fact he brought out a special package of chicken in my honor. \\nIt had no breasts.\\' You\\'ve got to be the leader.

Find a way to stand out.\" \\nMany comics emphasi/.e their persona by creating a slogan for them\\xad\\nselves. When Roseanne Barr called herself the \"domestic goddess\" on her tirsi Carson shot, her sitcom developed faster than you could say, \"Poor \\nnailer trash housewife mom.\" A monkey could have put together that sit\\xad\\ncom because Roseanne did all the hard work—she defined herself. Her \\nCatchphrase not only suggested who she was and her point of view, but \\nwho her target audience was. \\nPRO TAIK with Roseanne Ban (as told to me after a show at tiie Comedy Store) \\n\"Stand-up is my therapy, Judy. I\\'m just really pissed off!\" \\nA Writer\\'s Voice \\nIf you are a writer, you still need to hone your brand of comedy. Although \\nWriters are rarely thought to have a persona, they are said to have a voice. \\nThis term has always sounded weird to me because writers don\\'t speak— \\nthey write, thus no voice. Yet the word voice is currently heard at every \\nstudio meeting. \"I love this writer\\'s voice.\" \"His voice is very unique.\" \\n\"He has a very edgy voice.\" \"Her voice is very clear.\" And yet in over \\nforty-five interviews for this book, no one seemed able to define what it \\nmeans to have a voice. So I won\\'t try either. Instead, I will give you some \\nexamples. Trey Parker\\'s voice (he is co-creator and writer for South Park) is \\ndifferent from Larrv David\\'s voice (he is creator and writer of Seinfeld). \\nBoth are extremely funny, talented, and edgy, but their hit on things is \\ntotally different. Parker puts his South Park little kids in big situations, \\nwhile David\\'s Seinfeld characters are big people in little situations. At the \\nroot of what we all do is something unique and constant—a sort of \\nthrough line. It takes a lot of writing of what isn\\'t us to find what is. \\nPRO TAIK with Larry David \\n\"I like to take something tiny that just expands and see where it goes.\" m lust for performers: 8-by-IO black-and-white head shot with your name and \\ncontact information. Newspapers prefer photos that have a white or light \\nbackground. I wouldn\\'t go wacky with the picture. If you look at all the \\nsuccessful comics, you\\'ll notice very few of them are weird looking. As \\nwith everything else in life, handsome, cute, and attractive work best. \\nAlso have a few color pictures on your computer to e-mail to bookers, \\nagents, or newspapers. \\n• Resume—a listing of all your jobs, skills, and training. \\n\"But what am I going to put on my resume if I haven\\'t had a job?\" \\nLie—no. Exaggerate—yes. List all the comedy clubs and colleges \\nyou\\'ve played. It doesn\\'t have to say these were nonpaying gigs on ama\\xad\\nteur night. You\\'ve got to start somewhere. Writers, put on it anv sort \\nof writing jobs, newsletters, columns, spec scripts, and so on. On my \\nfirst resume I had parts I played in college, open mikes, my skills, my \\ntraining, and my teachers. It was very, very short but got longer as I \\ngot work. If you really have nothing to put on a resume, then just don\\'t \\nhave one. \\n• Biography—a cute story of your life and career. Write it as it would appear \\nin a magazine article about yourself. Keep it to one page or less, double-\\nspaced, and make it entertaining, funny, and informative. \\n• Just writers: writer\\'s package. This is a collection of writing samples that \\nshould be adapted according to the job opportunity. If you\\'re up for I he \\nLate Show with David Lctterman it would include top ten lists, current-\\nevent jokes, desk pieces, and remote ideas. If you are up for a sitcom staff \\nposition, it would be a spec script, and you can also add essay pieces if \\nthey reflect the tone of the show you\\'re applying for. \\n• lust performers: video. This is your most important marketing tool. The \\nvideo should be eight to twenty minutes depending on who you\\'re send\\xad\\ning it to, but don\\'t count on anyone watching more than the first three \\nminutes. Club owners and agents generally don\\'t like edited tapes with \\ncutaway shots to the audience. It looks like you\\'re hiding something. \\n• —Have a few versions of your act. I have a clean corporate tape, a \\nwomen\\'s issues tape, and a nightclub \"let it rip\" tape. \\n• —The audio on your videotape must be clear. This gets tricky \\nbecause if you use just the mike on the video camera, what you say \\nwill probably be hard to understand, while the conversation of the Exercise: What Is Your Brand of Comedy? \\nIn order to stand out from the pack, evaluate yourself. \\n1. What are your signature jokes? (Usually the jokes that get the biggest \\nresponse.) \\n2. What type of audience do you feel most comfortable in front of (corpo\\xad\\nrate types, college students, women, gays, Italians)? \\n3. What article of clothing suits you best? Rodney Dangerfield wears a rum\\xad\\npled coat and tie, giving him that \"I don\\'t get no respect\" look. \\n4. Create an ad for your act that sums up what you do and targets your \\naudience. What name would you give your show? Sandra Bernhard\\'s \\nsiand-up show was called Without You I\\'m Nothing. This summed up the \\ntone of her show. Six of my students got together and came up with Six-\\nPack of Comedy and had a clever flyer with their pictures on a six-pack of \\nbeer. What kind of picture would you have in the ad? Can you come up \\nwith a one-sentence phrase that sums you up? \\nYou\\'re doing a set at Comedy Night at Luigi\\'s Italian Restaurant and \\nsomeone says, \"Hey, you were funny. I\\'m a TV exec. How do I get hold ol \\nvou?\" Do vou (a) borrow a pen from him and scribble your phone num\\xad\\nber on the back of a napkin, (h) give him your business card, (c) get his \\nbusiness card? \\nI\\'d suggest both h and c. Do an Internet search on the guy to see if he \\nis the TV exec in charge ol something other than the mail room. And \\nerven if he is only working in the mail room, he probably knows someone. \\nAnytime you are noticed and liked, you need to make something of it. \\nThe first step is to have promotional materials with you at all times. \\nBoth writers and performers need the following: \\n• Stationary and business cards. Make them look as professional as possible, \\nwhich means resist the temptation to make them jokey. Performers, put a \\ncolor picture of yourself on your business card so when that drunk audi\\xad\\nence member digs your card out of his pocket on Sunday morning, your \\npicture and the word comic might stir brain cells. drunks seated near the camera will he crystal clear. The best situa\\xad\\ntion is to have two wireless mikes—one on you and one above the \\naudience 10 get the laughs. \\n—Keep your tape current. You need to look like your tape. One way \\nto keep your tape up to date is to invest in a video editing system. \\nI\\'m a gadgethead.

PR person who has represented Richard Lewis. \\nPaula Poundstone. Rita Rudnei; Robert Wuhl. Louie Anderson, and Judy \\nCarter \\n\"A PR package needs to be built around a comic\\'s persona with an \\ninteresting bio and the right picture. For example, with Richard Lewis, \\nyou think of an attitude. All black clothing and anxiety are very impor\\xad\\ntant parts of who he is. We heightened that in his PR package. You \\ndon\\'t want a cheery picture of Lewis when his persona is anguish. You \\nwant dark and interesting. You want every piece of PR to capture what \\nthat comedian is portraying.\" \\n• Design a flyer thai has a space to put the details of when and where you \\nare performing so you don\\'t have to redesign it every time you get a job. \\nThis flyer should visually express exactly who you are. When 1 first \\nstarted out and was doing a mix of magic and comedy, 1 made a copy of \\nan old-time magic flyer, \"Carter the Great,\" that had a picture of me \\ndoing a death-defying escape from my grandmother\\'s girdle. It got \\npeople\\'s attention and made them laugh. Keep the background light so \\nthat your fiver will reprint well in newspapers. \\n• Create postcards with blank spaces so that you can add the \"where\" and \\n\"when\" on a label. These are great handouts because they can fit in a \\npocket. \\nWhether you\\'re a writer or a performer you need to cultivate like-minded \\npeople who will get you. The audience for a New York-stvic comedy \\nwriter will be different from the audience for a Southern-style comedy \\nwriter. Not everyone will love what you do, but you need to find the peo\\xad\\nple who will. \\nFor performers, many of the gigs you get at the beginning of your \\ncareer will be \"bringer\" gigs. That is, you can perform only if you bring \\nfive paying audience members to the gig. Beginning comics bitch and \\nmoan about these gigs, but they are your PR training ground. You must \\ncreate your own fan base. If you can\\'t or won\\'t do it for yourself, why would an agent, manager, or producer want to do it for you? Bringer \\nrooms are your training grounds lor success. Unless YOU are Catholic, you \\nare going to run out of relatives fast. You need to cultivate a follow ins; \\nthat isn\\'t related to you. If you find that your material is hit-or-miss \\ndepending on the audience, don\\'t change your act—change your audi\\xad\\nence. If you want to talk about being gay, then perhaps performing at a \\nSouthern Baptist church open mike isn\\'t a good idea. Not everyone will \\nlike you, and that\\'s OK. \\nPRO TALK with T. J.

I got livers to \\ncolleges, to the gay bars—people that I thought would like what I do.\" \\nTips on Targeting Your Audience \\n• Keep a database. For writers, everv contact, every tip needs to be saved in \\na database. For performers, every performance is an opportunity to \\nexpand your database. If people really like you, they will want to see you \\nagain, and you need their data to build your audience. \\nIt\\'s difficult to get audience members to fill out data forms, and the \\nold \"Put your name on the mailing list at the back of the room\" doesn t \\ncut it. 1 suggest having drawings, contests, and free giveaways for those \\nwho do give you their info. It\\'s not something you can do during your \\nact, but certainly something that the MC can have fun with before and after it. Having a following will impress an agent and club owner more \\nthan the actual show. So once you get your fans\\' addresses, you must set \\nup a system—such as the software database ACT—so that you can easily \\nreach them. Go to our Web site for links and PR tips in setting up and \\nrunning a comedy database. \\n• E-mail people about where and when you are performing. Almost everyone has \\ne-mail, and using it is free. It\\'s a great way to let people know where you \\nare performing without bugging them too much. Tips on e-mailing: \\n• —Always have a \"remove from list\" option at the end of your e-mails. \\n• —Never send anyone an attachment; it pisses people off. If you want \\nthem to see the fab flyer for your show, then post the flyer on the \\nWeb and e-mail people the link. \\n• —Never show your e-mail list. Send all your e-mail \"blind carbon \\ncopy.\" \\n• —Put a short video of your act on your Web page. Just a lease. Never \\nput your entire act on the Internet because it will get ripped off and \\nthere is no way to prevent that from happening. Go to our Web site \\nfor information on how to transfer your video to streaming Web \\nvideo. \\n• Go to where like-minded people hang out—colleges, bars, temples, gay bars— \\nand hand out postcards and fivers. Don\\'t assume because you hand \\nsomeone a flyer that they will go to your gig. Talk to them. \\n• Donate time to charity. Volunteering to do your act for a benefit is a great \\nway to network and get a buzz out about what you do—plus it\\'s great for \\nyour karma. Find a charity (hat you relate to and either produce your \\nown fund-raiser or take part in theirs. I created a workshop for AIDS \\nProject L.A. where I taught stand-up lo people with AIDS. We called the \\nproject \"HIV, Humor is Vital,\" Twenty brave souls created material about \\nliving with AIDS and performed it at a comedy club. All the proceeds \\nwent to an AIDS charity. It created hope for the participants, raised con\\xad\\nsciousness and money, and it made the six o\\'clock news. \\n• Can\\'t find any place to do your act? Then do it in the street. Comic \\nMichael Colyar spent nine years shouting his act to passersby on the \\nboardwalk in Venice Beach, California. Producer Chuck Barris spotted \\nhim and put him on TV. Colyar went on to do an HBO special and Def \\njam appearances, and became recognized internationally as the Star \\nSearch winner who gave away half of his SI 00,000 earnings to the home\\xad\\nless. Moral of the story—get out of the house. PRO TALK with Frederick Lew, author of Haw to Succeed in Hollywood \\nWithout Connections. \\n\"Network.

I\\'m a member of the \\nNational Speakers Association, the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, \\nthe National Organization of Women, the Sierra Club, ACLU, SAG/ \\nAFTRA, and Women in Film, to name just a few.

I \\nwrote my most successful press release after 1 had done a few corpo\\xad\\nrate gigs and decided 1 wanted to do more. The headline was \"For\\xad\\ntune 500 companies turn to a stand-up comic to solve employee \\nproblems.\" The Wall Street Journal picked up on this press release and \\ndid a feature story on me. When it was published, the phone didn\\'t \\nstop ringing. A reprint resides at the front of my PR kit and it is still \\npulling in the jobs. \\n• —Don\\'t have anything to publicize? Then create an event. One time \\nright before I was to do my comedy/magic act at a club, I sent out a \\npress release announcing that I would be hanging upside down out\\xad\\nside a radio station, performing an escape from my grandmother\\'s \\ngirdle. The press release was sent to die radio station and to women\\'s \\norganizations. The station did a tie-in and gave away free tickets and \\ninterviewed me for several davs leading up to the event. A huge \\ncrowd gathered for the event. We handed out gobs of postcards pro\\xad\\nmoting my gig at the club. I sold out the week and got featured with \\na picture and a story in the newspapers. \\nAt the time outrageousness was my thing; of course, it may not \\nbe yours. You can do wacky things, but you must remain true to \\nyourself. Club owners will come up with crazy things that they want \\nyou to do, but don\\'t do anything that goes against who you are. \\n• —Get your press releases to the right people and spell their names \\nright. It takes extra time to call up the paper to find out exactly who \\nthe entertainment editor is, but the extra effort is worth it when your \\ninfo gets into the right hands. Also make sure that you are sending \\nstuff to the right publication.

A lot of newspapers have a \"Laugh Lines\" column and it\\'s a great \\nway to get your name in the papers. \\n\"But if my jokes get published, I won\\'t be able to use them. Right?\" \\nNot necessarily, but don\\'t give away your best bits. Instead, use this \\nas a way to get extra mileage out of current-event jokes that have a short \\nshelf life. Send in a comment piece with your spin on the hot topics of \\nthe moment. For instance, if \"road rage\" is the flavor of the month, then \\nwrite up funny ways to deal with road rage. You can write it as an article. a sidebar, a letter to the editor, or an opinion piece. It can end up in Time \\nmagazine, in your l\\'R kit, or at the least as a writing sample that will help \\noil you more jobs. \\nPRO TALK with Michelle Marx, publicist \\n\"Go to the publications that reflect who you are. I wanted to make a mar\\xad\\nriage of the right publication to the right client. For example, Paula \\n[Poundslone| is bright and writes well.

It\\'s about finding the \\npeople who would really relate to you and make them aware of yourself.\" \\nComedy Contests \\nContests are happening all the time. The prize money can be big and the \\nattention they garner even bigger. And even if you lose, the exposure can \\nstill help your career.

There arc also many festivals that specialize. For instance, \\nthe Moondance International Film Festival is a competition for women \\nscreenwriters, filmmakers, playwrights, and short-story writers.

Comedy Festivals \\nComedy festivals have become schmooze fests where comics and comedv \\nwriters network with other funny people, trade information, and rub \\nelbows with industry types. If you can afford the ticket, the following \\nNorth American festivals give you the opportunity to do just that. \\n• Tlie U.S. Comedy Arts festival, in Aspen (around March), also known as \\nthe Aspen Comedy Festival, is put on by HBO. It\\'s mostly a festival for \\nhigh-level comics and the VI Ps who Learjet in to see, ski, and schmooze. \\nBesides presenting new talent to the industry, they honor the stars of \\ncomedy. They\\'ve done a Monty Python reunion, a tribute to Robin \\nWilliams, and a Smothers Brothers Show reunion, where they brought back \\nall the original writers. If you can afford it and can find a hotel room, this \\nhigh-end festival is a must-see. \\nPRO TALK with Judi Brown, talent booker for the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival \\n\"1 see over two thousand acts a year, both nationally and internation\\xad\\nally—including stand-up, sketch, improv, theater pieces, and so on. I \\nthink that everybody sees somebody like me as just sitting in the back \\nof the club with her arms folded—judging and jaded. Not true. I\\'m \\ntotally inspired with what I do for a living. There is nothing in the \\nworld that would please me more than if you were an absolute knock\\xad\\nout. When you\\'re good, you make my job a lot easier. When I come \\nback from Iowa, 1 have to pitch to my boss what I\\'ve found. If I come \\nback and say, \\'There was nothing there,\\' then I didn\\'t do mv job right. \\nFor us it\\'s always about building relationships with talent and finding j \\ntalent that we can nurture.\" \\nThe just for Laughs Montreal International Comedv Festival. This is the \\nbiggest comedy festival in the world. It presents eight hundred artists, fif-\\nteen hundred shows, twenty countries, and takes place usually the last \\ntwo weeks of July. This bilingual event presents everything from up-and-\\ncoming new faces to established stars of the business from North Amer\\xad\\nica as well as from the U.K., Ireland, Scotland, South Africa, Australia. \\nNew Zealand, Trinidad, and Holland. PRO TALK with Bruce I lilts, lust for Laughs chief operating officer \\nJudy: What comics get to be in the festival? \\nBruce: If you\\'ve been doing open mikes for a couple of years, that\\'s \\nprobably a little green for our festival. \\nJudy: Is there a lot of Industry at the festival? \\nBruce: There are a handful of shows that are specifically pro\\xad\\ngrammed for the industry. The industry is looking for distinctive, \\nfunny comedians with something new to offer who can stand the pres\\xad\\nsure of having a TV show thrown on their shoulders, or at least to being \\na part of the cast. So, I\\'m not about to put people in the line of fire that \\naren\\'t ready for that. Of course, there are the Dave Chappelles of the \\nworld. I saw his tape when he was seventeen and I said this guy is a \\nsuperstar. He showed me four stand-up spots that were all different. \\nMost comics send me the same stupid material on four sets trying to \\nshow me that they\\'ve been on four shows but also showing me they \\ncant write more than eight minutes. Here\\'s this kid that\\'s brilliantly \\nfunny, original, who\\'s not swearing. \\nludy: You used a lot of words like original, different, and distinctive. \\nDo you mean what they talk about, or how they talk about those sub\\xad\\njects? \\nBruce: It\\'s both. There are some comics who have really wonderful, \\noriginal deliveries, but when you read what they\\'ve just done on paper, \\nit\\'s not that brilliant. And then you have other people who have bril\\xad\\nliant ideas but don\\'t have a clue how to deliver it. They just stand there \\nat a mike and bark out the material with no presentation and shitty \\nclothes and three days of beard. \\nJudy: If a comic has been working out and they feel that they are-\\nready, what do they do to get into the festival? \\nBruce: We look at every single tape that comes in and we gel any\\xad\\nwhere from five hundred to eight hundred a year. We also go on the \\nroad and have a small staff in LA. who screen comics for me to see on \\nmy trips to LA. Plus, we go to New York a couple times a year, hold \\ncomedy competitions across Canada, and visit a handful of U.S. \\ncities—Chicago, San Francisco, and Boston—every year. \\nJudy: Can you give some tips on what to do and what not to do on \\na videotape? \\n(continued) Bruce: Have your tape reflect the type of material you do best. We \\nhave all kinds of different theme shows—gay, black, a nasty show, a \\nMontreal show, a relationship show, a smart women\\'s show . . . Know \\nwhat your theme is and write it on the tape—\"1 have great relationship \\nmaterial, here\\'s seven minutes of it.\" If you have a really crazy, dirty act \\nand you\\'re very good . . . don\\'t send me the softened-down version, give \\nme the best of what you do. If you\\'re gay and you\\'ve got great gay \\nmaterial, don\\'t send me the crossover set because you want to be \\nbooked on five shows instead of one. Show me the best gay material \\nyou have. There\\'s a good chance that someone in the industry\\'s going \\nto be in every room that anyone performs at. \\nJudy: What about the quality of the tape? \\nBruce: If you have a hard time understanding what the hell you\\'re \\nsaying on a tape, how can you expect anyone else to get it? Don\\'t send \\na tape like that to anyone. The sound should be clear, the picture \\nshould be pretty good, and you should be funny, very funny. If you use \\na camera that\\'s stuck in the root of a comedv club, don\\'t run all over \\nthe stage so that you\\'re out of half of the shots. Hire someone to shoot \\nseveral of your performances over a period of a few days, then pick the \\nbest one and make plenty of copies of the tape. Sometimes I tell peo\\xad\\nple, \"You\\'re really funny; send me a tape.\" And it comes in six weeks. It \\nboggles my mind—in six weeks I can lose interest, forget, and book \\nsomeone else. But if you don\\'t think you\\'re ready, don\\'t send us a tape, \\nbecause we\\'ll probably write you off for a couple of years. We keep \\nnotes on every single person. I think we\\'ve got six or seven thousand \\nnotes in the computer. We can\\'t see everyone, so if someone is shaking \\nat the microphone and not original, we know they\\'re not going to be a \\nwhole lot better in six months. \\nJudy. If you reject someone for one festival, do they have a chance \\nfor another one? \\nBruce: Yes, as long as they\\'re moving in the right direction. But they \\nshouldn\\'t send me the same tape that got them turned down—send me \\none that\\'s a whole lot better. And if it takes three years to have a better \\none, then wait three years. \\n• Big Stinkin Improv Festival, Austin, Texas. BS is the largest annual improv \\nand sketch comedy festival of its kind. Improv and sketch troupes from all over the world show their stuff to other performers, industry reps, ami \\nTexans. In addition, cutting-edge comics and Improv pros teach a variety \\nof workshops. The festival is held in Austin, lexas, in October. Improv \\ntroupes can register online at ivivw.bigstinkin.com. \\nu California Comedy Conference, Palm Springs, California. Everyyear I hold a \\ncomedy workshop weekend where stand-up comics and comedy writers \\ntake classes, showcase, and network with industry professionals, such as \\nagents, managers, studio executives, casting directors, producers, and top \\ncomedy coaches. Beginning comics and writers are welcome to attend. \\nThe comedy workshop weekend lakes place in November. You can regis\\xad\\nter at mvw.comedyworkshopS.com. \\nShowcasing for Comics \\nA showcase is a show produced by a comic or manager that is targeted to \\nthe industry. It\\'s kind of like a debutante ball for comics—you\\'re present\\xad\\ning yourself to the world, saying, \"I\\'m good, I\\'m ready for the big time, \\nand in ten minutes you\\'re going to want me.\" \\nAgents may organize these nights for the talent they represent, other-\\nwise it is a matter of getting an agent down to see you, and with a small \\nand tight industry it isn\\'t long before you know everyone and everyone \\nknows you. Agents are often hired by venues to program comedy, and so \\nyou will often find many agents or their representatives are at the venues. \\nSIN tips for producing a successful showcase: \\n1. Hire a professional to design the flyers for your showcase. You don\\'t want \\nit to look like you\\'re putting on an amateur night talent show. It doesn\\'t \\nmatter how good you are if no one shows up. \\n2. Mention in the flyer that there will be free food and drinks. It\\'s a surefire \\nway to gel lots of industry people to your show. It\\'s amazing what a \\nbunch of rich people will do for free BBQ chicken wings and cosmopoli\\xad\\ntans. \\n3. Make sure everyone who is anyone in the industry gets your flyer. In Los \\nAngeles, the Breakdown Service (www.breaMomiservices.com) will hand-\\ndeliver your promotional flyers or invitations to every active producer, \\nagent, manager, and casting director in Los Angeles within seventy-two \\nhours. This is the easiest way to get the word out. We do this at our \\nworkshop showcases at the Improv in LA. and always get a good indus\\xad\\ntry turnout. \\n4. Fill the audience with civilians—nonindustrv folks. Nothing is worse than an audience of just industry people—they aren\\'t known to be big \\nlaughers. \\n5. Even though this is a showcase, take risks with your material and be in \\nthe moment. Too often showcases come off dull because everyone is so \\noverrehearsed that they lose their edge. \\n6. Professionally videotape the showcase. The next day call all the people \\nwho didn\\'t show up and ask them if they would care to view the video. \\n\"I\\'ve been doing a lot of stand-up and getting a good response. When \\nis it time to quit my day job and do comedy full time?\" \\nGenerally, that depends on how easily you can adjust to being poor. \\nThe poorer and younger you are, the easier it is to do comedy full time \\nbecause it doesn\\'t entail a big change in your lifestyle. When you\\'re in \\nyour forties and have a day job that pulls in the bucks, it\\'s hard to give \\nthat up to live in an \\'86 Chevy Astro Van just so you can open for some\\xad\\none in Kansas. \\nr PRO TALK with Richard Jeni \\n\"I kept doing comedy even when 1 was bombing because I felt there \\nwas nothing else 1 could do. It was kind of like the film An Officer and a \\nGentleman—\\'1 have no place else to go!\\' That kind of melodrama in \\nyour own mind is helpful. It\\'s so hard at the beginning that if you feel \\nyou have other options you\\'ll probably take them. But if you back \\nyourself into a corner psychologically, like this is the last stop, there\\'s \\nno place else to go, then you\\'ll stick with it.\" Many comedy performers and writers work for free for many, many \\nyears before they see a paycheck. Screenwriter/director Nora Ephrori \\nwrote ten scripts that never got made before one of her unused screen\\xad\\nplays drew the attention of ICM\\'s Sam Cohn, who was looking for a \\nwriter to turn Karen Silkwood\\'s life into a movie for Meryl Streep. \\nI was fortunate. When I was twenty-two, I got fired from my first job, \\nas a high school teacher. This made me desperate—which was good. I had \\nalways had an act and had performed at frat parties and temple mixers \\nthroughout college. But 1 had given up performing the two years I spent \\nteaching because I didn\\'t have the time or energy. Being fired was the best \\nthing that could have happened to me and my career. It was 1974, before \\nthe comedy club boom, and Playboy Clubs were the main venue for \\ncomics. When I called up the local Playboy Club to audition, they told \\nme to talk to their talent booker, Irvin Arthur. I called him—a lot—but \\nnever got a return call. So I naively went to his office with my little magic \\nact. I told his secretary, \"Hello, I\\'m a magician/comedian and I would like \\nto work at the Playboy Club.\" She told me that he never saw anyone \\nwithout an appointment. So 1 sat in the reception area for five hours. Mr. \\nArthur must have felt sorry for me because he finally came out and \\ninvited me into his office. I did my act for him, right there in his office, \\nand that night I had a gig at the L.A. Playboy Club—I got $50 and din\\xad\\nner! When Irvin quit, his job, he became a manager—my manager—and \\nhe kept me working forty-five weeks a year for five years. Desperation can \\nmake you very determined. \\nBeing ready means that not only is your work good but you arc will\\xad\\ning to put your butt on the line. \\nPRO TALK with Michelle Marx, publicist \\n\"You have to keep going past the rejection. Don\\'t take it to heart. \\nWhen you put yourself out there it can make you feel naked. It helps to \\nsometimes look at yourself as a business.\" \\n\"How do I know if I am good enough to move to a big city and get an \\nagent?\" \\nEven though you might be winning comedy contests, or your English \\nteacher in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, thinks your scripts are really funny, don t immediately rush off to L.A. or New York. Mega manager Bernie Brill-\\nStein wisely suggests that new comics not show their act to any industry \\npeople until they are better than the competition. \"If you are a kid from \\nOhio, then look at the competition in Cleveland. If you are better than \\nairsone there, take a step out and go to New York to work at a few com\\xad\\nedy clubs. If you still think you are good there, then believe me, someone \\nwill find you in a club or in L.A. You are not going to be discovered in \\nCleveland, but wait until you are ready.\" \\nFor writers, the best way to get good is to keep writing, script after \\nscript, story after story, joke after joke. For comics, the road is the best \\nplace to work out your material. Comic Rocky LaPorte spent forty weeks \\na year on the road until he got a TV pilot and development deal with \\nCBS. LaPorte won the Johnnie Walker comedy contest and signed with \\nan agent, but it was four years before he felt he was ready to tackle L.A. \\nPRO TALK with comic Rocky LaPorte \\n\"Everyone was telling me to go to L.A. and get on TV I didn\\'t do it \\nbecause I knew I wasn\\'t ready for LA. I stayed on die road for four \\nmore years until I felt I was ready. You are ready when you have devel\\xad\\noped some depth and character, and can work any crowd. You have to \\nbomb to succeed. Some comics spend all their time honing a ten-\\nminute set that only works in New York. Then they go to Nashville. \\nwhere their chunk on subways doesn\\'t work because Nashville doesn\\'t \\nhave subways. You have to know how to work all the slates. The road is \\nlike college and you need it like an education.\" \\nYour First Agent Is You \\nIn the beginning stages of a career you will meet agents who will want to \\nrepresent or manage you. Very often these people have the same client \\nlist as Woody Allen\\'s character in Broadway Danny Rose—plate spinners, \\ndog acts, and a guy whose claim to fame is snorting nickels up his nose \\nand out his mouth. (True story: my first agent.) These guys can some-i imes bring you a couple of extra bucks, but in order to become successful \\nbefore osteoporosis sets in, you need to get a really good agent. \\nWouldn\\'t it be great to have someone who looks after every detail (lf \\nyour career? Someone who can get you stage time and who knows what\\'s \\ngoing on in the business? Someone to negotiate your contracts and make \\nsure that the checks don\\'t bounce? Someone whose sole focus in life is \\nmaking sure that you succeed? Guess what? Not only does this person \\nexist, but you are about to sign on with him. Who is this agent extraordi\\xad\\nnaire? Take a look in the mirror. \\nIf you are serious about a career in comedy, you must form your own \\nagency—an agency that represents the interests of only one client: you. \\nYou will never get more personal attention than when you are the onh \\nclient. And if you\\'re working on commission and have only one client, \\nyou\\'re going to do everything possible to try to get that client work so \\nyou can pay your bills. \\n\"But I don\\'t know anything about the business. Shouldn \\'t my first \\nstep be getting a real agent?\" \\nNo. The first step is becoming really good at what you do and learn\\xad\\ning how to represent yourself. Eventually, you will have to represent yourself \\nto an agent, so you must know how to sell yourself. \\nMost of us grow up with the dream that someone will discover us— \\nrecognize our talent and remove the burden of having so much unrealized \\npotential. Women especially fall victim to this \"Someday my prince will \\ncome\" sort of thinking. If you think someone is going to come along and \\ntake over the business end of things so that you can just be creative, \\nyou\\'re living in fantasyland. Repeat after me: \"Nobody is coming.\" \\nNobody with half a brain is going to work that hard to get 10 percent of \\nthe kind of money you\\'ll be lucky to earn right now. You want to be dis\\xad\\ncovered? Discover yourself. Sign yourself. Represent yourself. Become the \\nagent you\\'ve dreamed of getting. \\n\"But Judy, practically all successful comics and writers have agents \\nand managers.\" \\nYes, they do. But all of them had something going on that interested \\nan agent before that agent signed them. And that something they created \\nfor themselves. Even big stars can\\'t afford to totally turn things over to \\nsomeone else. The entertainment trade papers are filled with stories about big stars going bankrupt because they turned their businesses and \\ncareers over to agents and managers who then mismanaged their affairs. \\nGarry Shandling sued his manager and friend. Brad Grey, for Si00 \\nmillion, alleging that Grey improperly leveraged his relationship with \\nShandling to benefit his other business interests and clients. Grey coun-\\ntersued Shandling for S10 million, accusing Shandling of \"aberrant and \\nirresponsible behavior.\" Every agent and manager\\'s number one client is \\nthemselves, so if you want to be top dog, you have to look out for your \\nown interests and not trust someone else to do it. \\nEven if you get a good agent who has a lot of connections, unless you \\npersonally nurture and maintain those contacts, you\\'ll lose them when \\nyou lose the agent—and you will lose an agent (or ten) over the course of \\nvour career. Agents use the \"Let\\'s throw everything against the wall and \\nsee what sticks\" policy. They court you, sign you, and then, ifyou don\\'t \\nget something going, dump you. \\nPRO TALK with Phyllis Oilier \\n\"If an agent had a brain in his ass he\\'d be doing it himself. An agent \\ndoesn\\'t want you until you\\'re making at least $5,000 a week. Ait \\nagency doesn\\'t want you until you are making a million a week. They \\nare interested in one thing, money. They are not in die business of \\ndeveloping talent. You are. You are the only one who is ever going to \\nknow what is right for you.\" \\n\"Changing agents is like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.\" \\n—ANONYMOUS \\n\"Don\\'t people need to have relatives in the business?\" \\nIt helps to a certain point. People will give a relative or a friend a \\nbnak, but if you don\\'t have the talent, drive, and business savvy to back \\nup a nepotistic opportunity, you\\'ll never be more than so-and-so\\'s cousin. \\nLook what being related to a star did for the acting careers of Sly Stal\\xad\\nlone\\'s and Tom Hanks\\'s brothers. Didn\\'t know that they had brothers in \\nthe business? You get my point. Starting Your Own Comedy Management Business \\nIn the eighties, I dumped my never-return-a-call agent and decided that I \\nwould manage my own career. I created the management firm of Keller-\\nStevens. I made it legal by getting a DBA (doing business as) and hired a \\nprofessional to design my logo, contracts, and stationery. My manager\\'s \\nname became \"Pam Keller.\" Pam was tough as nails, with a heavy New \\nYork accent and a no-nonsense approach to booking her favorite and only \\nclient—me. Putting people on hold was an important component of look\\xad\\ning like a successful management firm. Radio Shack supplied me with \\na hold button and Muzak for my phone. 1 developed the character of \\nPam\\'s secretary, \"Doris,\" in my improv class. Doris was a bit ditsy but \\nhad all the charm that Pam lacked. \"Keller-Sievens Management, may I \\nhelp you?\" Of course, all of these characters were really me, sitting in my \\nbathrobe in my converted garage and talking in different voices. \\nKeller-Stevens Management (nobody, including me, ever knew who \\n\"Stevens\" was) got me a lot of work. I remember one club owner saying, \\n\"Pam, saw Judy when I was in L.A. and I don\\'t think she has any talent.\" \\nAny other agent would have offered the club owner another client: \"If \\nyou don\\'t like Judy, what about Rita Rudner?\" But Pam didn\\'t take no tor \\nan answer. \"How could you judge her when she was trying out new mate\\xad\\nrial?\" Pam scolded him. \"Look at her videotape at least. Do you think I\\'d \\nwaste my time managing her if she wasn\\'t brilliant!\" Cut to—Pam got me \\nthe job. \\nPam reached the peak of her career when I was playing in Indianapo\\xad\\nlis. David Letterman called the club asking about the tuysterious Pam \\nKeller, whom he had never met. But this deception became too confusing \\nwhen other comics called and asked Pam to manage them too. It was also \\ndifficult when Pam and Judy had to be in the same place. Pam was the \\nonly manager in history who never \"did lunch\" with anyone. This \\nmethod of representing yourself is recommended only to those with a \\nstrong sense of adventure and several personalities. The rest of you will \\nprobably do better using the buddy method. \\nYou and your comedy buddy go into the management business \\ntogether and make calls on each other\\'s behalf. This works especially well \\nif the two of you are not competing for the same jobs. For instance, one oi \\nyou is a performer and the other is a writer, or you are different genders-\\nIt s a lot easier selling someone other than yourself. PRO TALK with Richard Jeni \\n\"I have a corporation. Ii is not a company in the sense that you can drive \\nby the Richard )eni building in downtown L.A., but I am incorporated. \\nWhich is ironic because one of the reasons people become comedians is \\nto avoid traditional business activities. But the minute you become even \\na little successful, suddenly you find yourself running a company and \\nhaving employees. A person chooses to have a company because they \\nwant to operate at a certain level. I spend a tremendous amount of time \\ndealing with people, publicity, money, and managers and agents and all \\nthat crap. Your first goal is becoming successful, and your second goal is \\nliving not lo fall off your perch and go back down.\" \\nSetting Up Your Company \\nWhether you are starting your business alone or with a buddy, you will \\nneed to make it official by registering your company, creating a mission \\nstatement, and having proper contracts, stationery, and basic office \\nequipment. This is not an unusual practice. Most successful performers \\nform their own companies to create, develop, and produce projects for \\nthemselves. If you\\'re sitting there whining, \"But, I\\'m just not the business \\ntype.\" heed the wise words of Joan Rivers—\"Grow up!\" \\nGetting a Name \\nYour company name should reflect what you do. Mine is Comedy Work\\xad\\nshop Productions. Pretty clear about what it is that we do. My friend Car\\xad\\nmen McKay is a corporate humorist and her company name says it all, \\nCorporate Comedy. You don\\'t have to be as literal as I was, but your com\\xad\\npany name should reflect your tone or style. David Letterman\\'s company \\nis Worldwide Pants. The name reflects his irreverent style. Garry Shan-\\ndling is obsessed with his hair. Name of his company—How\\'s My Hair? \\nExercise: Creating Your Company Name \\nYou don\\'t want your company name to limit you. For instance, if you \\nwant to do dramatic acting as well as stand-up comedy, you probably don\\'t want your company name to be Butt Funny Inc. This exercise will \\nhelp you explore all possibilities before deciding on a company name. \\nDo a mind map (see page 183 on how to mind map) of your career. \\nPut what you currently like doing the most in the center balloon. Then \\nwrite down all the offshoots. Keep creating circles, and include all of vour \\ncareer hopes and dreams. When you think you\\'re finished, push yourself \\nto go further. Spend at least two days on this. Then play with the words \\non the page and whatever other words come to mind to find the right \\nname for your company. \\nWrite the name of your company here: \\nCreate a Mission Statement \\nA mission statement describes the services, intentions, and possibilities of \\nyour company. It should include what you do and what you plan on \\ndoing. \\nMy friend Carmen McKay, who created the company Corporate \\nComedy, guided me and my \"staff\" (my comedy buddy and my assistant) \\nin coming up with the mission statement for my company. The three of \\nus wrote down words that described what the company did as well as \\nideas about what we could do in the future. On a bulletin board, we \\ntacked up forty-five little pieces of paper—each with a descriptive word— \\nand then narrowed them down to the most important ones: comedy, books, \\nworkshop, projects, inspire, educate, transform, film, theater, TV, clubs, Internet, \\nlaughter, entertainment worldwide, authenticity. After a little rearranging we \\nended up with our mission statement: \\nComedy Workshop Productions creates comedy projects that inspire, \\neducate, and transform others in the mediums of film, theater, TV, clubs, \\nbooks, the Internet, and workshops where people learn how to spread \\nlaughter and entertainment throughout the world coming from their \\nown authenticity. \\nMaking It Legal \\nOnce you\\'ve decided on your company name and mission statement, it\\'s \\ntime to make it official. In Australia you can register your business name with the Department of Fair Trading, or contact the Australian Tax Oil ice \\nto create a business and get an Australian Business Number (ABN). \\n\"Why do I need to get so legal-schmegal with all of this?\" \\nYou may not be Dreamworks, but you are going to be issuing contracts \\nusing your company name, and if there is any trouble in collecting money, \\nvou need to make sure that you\\'ve crossed your Ts and dotted your 7s. \\nOffice Hours \\nAll businesses need regular hours. If you have been working on getting \\ngood, you probably have regular writing hours. Now you need to also \\nschedule, and commit to keeping, regular office hours—even if your day \\njob is an office job. \\nOffice Equipment \\n(let yourself the basics: \\n• phone with an answering service \\n• pager/cell phone \\n• Internet service and e-mail \\n• fax/copier \\n• computer/printer \\nSigning Your First Contract \\nSign up your management company\\'s first artist—yourself. Then make \\nsure that artist pays you. Managers get 15 percent of their clients\\' gross \\nincome. Use that money to pay for phone calls, Internet services, office \\nequipment, and other items and services that will enable your company \\nto grow. \\nWrite down the specific career goals you will achieve for your client \\n(you), such as \"book open mikes to develop his craft,\" \"create show\\xad\\ncases.\" \"make showbiz big shots aware of him,\" \"focus on booking the \\ncorporate market.\" Make it official by writing out a contract of intent, \\nand then sign it. Congrats, you have just signed your first client. I he first question anyone in power will ask is, \"What has she done?\" \\n\"Nothing\" is not a good answer. It\\'s hard to find someone in Hollywood \\nwho will give a job to an unknown. Showbiz big shots are more likely to \\npay attention to you if someone else in showbiz has already noticed you. \\n\"But Judy, this sounds like a catch-22. Nobody will give me a break \\nunless someone else gives me a break. What should I do?\" \\nIt costs a lot of money to produce a TV show and no one is going to \\nrisk those millions on an unknown. However, there are other respected \\nfields that welcome newcomers and will give you that all-important first \\nbreak—theater, radio, public access TV, the Internet. Nowadays it\\'s not \\nenough to just be a stand-up comic or a sitcom writer. You have to diver\\xad\\nsify, expand into other fields. That way, when you finally do meet with a \\npowerful agent, manager, or producer, you\\'ll be able to say, \"I\\'m a stand-\\nup comic and I\\'m also a published writer, I have a regular spot on a radio \\nshow, and I\\'m making a buck on the college market. I would like to show \\nyou my comedy reel. It\\'s a compilation of shorts that I wrote, produced, \\nstarred in, and directed, which is airing today on channel 52.\" This gives \\nan agent something to work with. \\nPRO TALK with Michelle Marx, publicist \\n\"Stay aware of what\\'s going on around you that might provide clever \\nopportunities. Be timely. I pitched a show about Richard Lewis giving \\n\\'wrong advice\\' on Valentine\\'s Day to MTV and they went for it. We \\nhad people write in weeks ahead for wrong advice. It got. a few weeks of \\nMTV airtime for him and reinforced his persona to our target market.\" \\nBecome a Produced Playwright \\nCan\\'t get anyone to read your sitcom scripts? Produce them yourself as \\nplays. In 1984 I wrote, produced, and starred in a musical with a cast of \\neight, Goddess of Mystery. When my play got rave reviews in the LA Times, L.A. Weekly, and Variety, the phone started to ring. I was called in to \\naudition for TV parts. The Meii> Griffin Show (a talk/variety show of the \\nseventies and eighties) booked me to perform a part of the play, and \\nWarner Bros. TV offered me a development deal to convert the play into \\na sitcom. Not bad results for just renting a ninety-nine-seal theater. \\nPRO TALK with Ellen Sandler, executive producer of\\'Everybody Loves \\nRaymond, Coach, and many others \\n\"I got into sitcoms by writing and coproducing a one-act play with two \\nactors. One of them was living with Danny DeVito at the time and he \\nbrought everyone down from Taxi (the hit TV sitcom) to see it, and I \\ngot hired to write for Taxi with my partner.\" \\ni \\nWhether you are doing a one-person show or have a cast of many, \\nworkshop your project before you take it public. Director/manager Irene \\nPenn took Sherry Glaser\\'s one-person show Family Secrets on the road for \\nthree and a half years before she felt it was ready to go to New York. And \\nhow do you know when something is ready? Ms. Penn says, \"It\\'s instinct. \\nAfter workshopping your project, take it to venues that have similar audi\\xad\\nences. Since we wanted to end up with a New York show, we took the \\nplay to Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Coconut Grove, because most of the peo\\xad\\nple there are retired ex-New Yorkers.\" \\nPRO TALK with Irene Penn. producer/director \\nJudy: What\\'s better, doing a play in Los Angeles or New York? \\nIrene: Los Angeles has a certain mold for actresses. If you look like \\nCandy Bergen, you are ready for L.A. If you don\\'t fit into that mold, \\nthen take the play to New York because they look beyond appearances \\nto deeper emotional issues. If you are doing an edgy piece, you\\'ll get \\nnoticed there. Become a Published Writer by Having Your Work Appear in Newspapers, \\nMagazines, and Trade Newsletters \\nBeing published is very prestigious and none too difficult. A weekly col\\xad\\numn is a great way to publicize yourself. Every profession has trade mag\\xad\\nazines. Determine which ones your target audience reads and write a \\nhumor piece for them. For instance. 1 wrote an article for the Jewish Jour\\xad\\nnal. In the byline 1 included my contact info, phone number, and e-mail, \\nand 1 ended up getting all the temple mixers I could stand. Hey, it\\'s a liv\\xad\\ning. Dave Barry started by writing a humor column for the local paper. It \\nattracted attention and was rerun elsewhere. One thing led to many oth\\xad\\ners. In 1983 he joined the staff of the Miami Herald. He\\'s also written \\nover twenty humor books and won a Pulitzer Prize for commentary jour\\xad\\nnalism. \\nPRO TALK with Cindy Ckupack, producer/writer \\n\"I submitted a personal essay to a New York magazine and it got pub\\xad\\nlished. My TV writing career was launched when a sitcom producer saw \\nthat piece. I eventually got a staff job on the sitcom Coach. Years later \\nmy essays, which I had continued writing, were key in getting me the \\njob on IIBO\\'s Sex in the City. I had written Coach and Everybody Loves \\nRaymond, but the only sample that could show them that I could do \\nthis show were these essays about dating and sexual ethics. It was those \\nessays that got me the job of co-executive producer.\" (Note. Ms. Chu-\\npack was nominated lor an Emmy for her work on Sex in the (ity.) \\nSelf-Publish Your Own Book \\nYou don\\'t have to wail for a big publishing house to publish your book \\nbecause you can self-publish it or get your work published on-line. Authors \\ngenerally receive royalties of 7 to 10 percent of paperback sales from major \\npublishers. Self-publishers, on the other hand, can see as much as a 50 per\\xad\\ncent return on investment; however, that means that the author has to pay \\nin advance for the bookbinding, artwork, publicity, and editing. There are \\nalso Internet sites such as www.fatbrain.com that will sell w hat you write over \\ntheir Web site and take a percentage. For more information on the self-publishing market, a good resource book is Dan Poynter\\'s The Self-Publishing \\nManual (Para Publishing, $ I 9.95). \\nProduce Your Own CD \\nWorkshop student Amy Borkowsky thought that her overly protective \\nmother\\'s messages on her answering machine were so funny that she \\nplayed them in her stand-up act. When audience members requested \\ncopies of them, she produced a CD of them and created a Web site \\n(wmv.seiidamy.com). Amy eventually took time off from her day job to pro\\xad\\nmote the CD and got a lot of radio stations to play portions of it. Cut \\nto—Any featured in Life, Jane, Mademoiselle, Newsday, and on the Today \\nSlum; Lifetime, and MSNBC. In one year she has sold over a hundred \\nthousand copies of her CD and received offers to develop a sitcom based \\non her relationship with her mom. As Amy told me, \"I didn\\'t do it for the \\nmoney. The money just showed up. I did it because I really believed in the \\nproject and it became a passion for me.\" \\nProducing your act or short stories on CD is cheap and something \\nyou can do on your computer with the right software. (See our Web page \\nfor details on producing your own CD.) CDs cost about fifty cents each \\nand are a great adciition to your PR package as well as a great source of \\nrevenue. \\nBecome a Regular Guest on the Radio \\nComic Robin Roberts was hired as a writer and voice performer for D( \\nRick Dees at Los Angeles radio station KITS FM through sheer luck. \\n\"Rick\\'s producer came across my picture and resume, called me, and \\nasked me to record a bit with him over the phone. He liked it, and invited \\nme to join the Cast of Idiots, Rick\\'s staff of radio comics. I got S50 for \\neach piece I wrote and an additional S50 for performing it. Best of all. 1 \\ncould do the job over the phone in my underwear.\" \\nBe the Star of Your Own Public Access TV Show \\nHave an idea for a TV show but no one will buy it? Do it vourself. Public-\\naccess really provides the best opportunity for someone who doesn\\'t have \\nthe Hollywood package—the agent, financing, and so forth—but is dedi\\xad\\ncated. With enough time, chutzpah, and sometimes money, anybody can \\nproduce a show. People do watch—sometimes even the right people. Iii 1992, Colin Malone, a struggling stand-up comic, and his friend \\nDino Everett were working at a video store in L.A. when they decided to \\ncreate a halt-hour public access show. Colin\\'s Sleazy Friends has hit cult \\nrage status and is now one of the most talked about in southern Cali\\xad\\nfornia, with mainstream celebrities such as Drew Carey and (aneane \\nGarofalo joining porno stars and weird acts. It is one of the few access \\nprograms that air in a regular weekly time slot—Wednesdays at midnight, \\ntaking away viewers from Letterman and Leno. And now with the help of \\nthe True Blue Network and satellite television, millions view it world\\xad\\nwide. \\nIf in Australia, check with the Community Broadcast Association of \\nAustralia for their production procedures. \\nProduce, Direct, Star in, and Distribute Your Own Comedy Videos \\nYou want to write, act, and direct? So do it. The price of high-quality dig\\xad\\nital video equipment is rapidly dropping, which means anyone can start \\ntheir own comedy production company and distribute their videos via \\nthe Internet. Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park fame created a \\nshort Christmas cartoon that they sent as a Christmas video to Holly\\xad\\nwood Studios. Cut to—a deal with the Comedy Channel. Writer Eric \\nKaplan created an Internet animated series for lcebox.com. Zombie Col\\xad\\nlege. The series was then bought by Fox Broadcasting Company, marking \\nthe first lime a show created for the Net has been purchased by a major \\ntelevision network. After Gene Laufenberg\\'s dark-comedy ten-minute \\nfilm Sunday\\'s Game premiered on ifilm.com, Laufenberg signed a two-\\npicture deal with Fox 2000. \\nBecome a Star in the College Market or on the Club circuit \\nThe college market books acts based on talent, not connections. Anyone \\ncan submit a tape to the NACA (National Association of Campus Activi\\xad\\nties, ivnnv.naca.org) or the smaller APCA (Association for the Promotion or \\nCollege Activities, mm.apcaxom). Both organizations arrange showcases \\ndirectlv with the college buyers; they have regional conferences; plus they \\nboth meet once a year at a national conference. Campus buyers attend \\nthe showcases looking for entertainers, agencies, presenters, and services \\nfor their school programs. Performers can submit a video after completing \\nan application and sending in a fee. The organizers at the NACA are obli\\xadgated to watch at least the first three minutes of every tape submitted, \\nthe APCA will watch twenty minutes of each tape and return all fees it \\nyou are not selected. There are also special college agents who represent \\ncomics. They generally take a cut of 15 to 30 percent of the fee. They \\nlook for clean one-hour acts that are aimed at the seventeen-to-twentv-\\ntwo age range. \\nWhile Australia doesn\\'t have a college circuit as such, there are thou\\xad\\nsands of registered clubs. They are not privately owned but arc looselv \\nbased around a common purpose, such as sports or unions. Thev often \\nhave some amazing facilities, including beautiful showrooms. It is quite \\ncommon for well-known comedians to put together a \\'one night stand\\' \\ntour through clubs, where the club takes the bar profits and the performer \\nthe door and merchandise sales. \\nBecome a Successful Corporate Humorist \\nEvery day there are business meetings in your area that hire entertainers. \\nIf you have material that would be appropriate for a certain company, \\ncontact that company directly One of my students was the greeter at \\nBanana Republic. She based her stand-up act on her job. I suggested that \\nshe ask her boss to let her do five minutes at their next corporate meet\\xad\\ning. She killed and went on to do national Banana Republic meetings for \\nthe big bucks. Another student, Ann Lippert, had a routine about shop\\xad\\nping at Home Depot. She submitted her tape and got a gig at their \\nChristmas party. \\nWhen calling a company make sure you are giving your spiel to the \\nright person. Ask for the event planner. Usually someone in Human \\nResources will know who that person is. \\nSubmit Jokes to Greeting Card Companies \\nMany greeting card companies pay for jokes and create the artwork (hem-\\nselves. There are many card companies on-line, such as bhiemmtntain.com \\nand tinkpeards.com. Contact each company to find out their submission \\nprocedure. PRO TALK with Rob Lotterstein \\n(When sitcom writer Rob Lotterstein was just siarting out, he wanted \\nto find a professional working writer to read his spec script.) \"1 called \\n(eft Stepakoff, who was a working TV writer. I met him because my \\nfriend Larry had a friend named Mark. Mark was friends with this guy \\nDavid, and David\\'s girlfriend\\'s best friend, Michelle, grew up with Jeff. \\nI got his number from Michelle and said 1 was Michelle\\'s friend. He \\nwas very happy to hear from me, read my script, gave me tips, and \\nintroduced me to other people in the industry. Everyone is connected \\nto someone in the industry.\" \\nWarning! Don\\'t do the \"Six Degrees of Separation\" exercise (page \\n328) until you are ready and are really good, otherwise you will burn con\\xad\\ntacts—fast. \\nPRO TALK with Richard Lewis \\n\"My first break was meeting David Brenner at the Improv in New York \\nand we became fast friends. He taught me a lot about the business and \\nkept me from foolishly burning bridges. lie advised me to wait six \\nmonths before coming to the Improv and to go perform in some of \\nthese hellholes. I would drive hours to do five or ten minutes—and do \\nit night after night. After six months I did an open-mike night at the \\nImprov and 1 was head and shoulders above the rest of the group. \\nDon\\'t burn your bridges needlessly. Give yourself some time to perfect \\nvour craft.\" \\nWhen you go after the big shots, make sure you have your persona \\nnailed and your material down. When David Letterman was working the \\nComedy Store in Hollywood, he was managed by Buddy Morra. Buddy \\nwould watch Letterman\\'s act every night and wouldn\\'t let anyone see \\nhim for years. He made sure he had developed his own style and felt con\\xad\\nfident before he brought any VIPs to see him. \\nIt\\'s nice if your aunt Edith thinks your spec script is really funny but it\\'s \\nfantastic if the executive producer of a hit NBC] sitcom feels that way. \\nUnfortunately big shots will return a call onlv if \\n• you\\'re a name who\\'s already making gobs of money \\n• they saw vour schtick or read your script and liked you \\n• you\\'re introduced to them bv someone they know and respect \\n• you\\'re a relative \\n• you\\'re a friend of a relative \\n• vou\\'re a friend of a friend \\nm vou give sexual favors freely \\n\"There are never any industry VIPs in the audience on open-mike \\nnight at Shakey\\'s Pizza Parlor, and my relatives are all in the heavy \\nfarm equipment business. How will I ever get an introduction to a big \\nshot?\" \\nThere are only six degrees of separation between you and the head of \\ncomedy development at ABC. The trick is to find the right six people. \\n\"But shouldn\\'t 1 get a real agent first before I approach these people?\" \\nThe people who are your six degrees ol\" separation can be agents, but \\nmost successful people make things happen before they get an agent. \\nYou\\'re much more attractive to an agent if some VIPs are already nuts \\nabout you. PRO TALK with David Letterman, talking in Esquire about Jay Lena\\'s impact \\non his work \\n\"Well, you go 10 the Comedy Store night after night and you see these \\npeople, like yourself, floundering to develop an identity One night I \\nsaw a guy named Jay Leno onstage [and] I thought I just might as well \\ngo home. Because his attitude and his style were so crystallized and so \\nright on the money and he had such good observations. I mean his \\nentire life and existence seemed to be a set-up and then he would pro\\xad\\nvide the perfect punchline. I thought, \\'Jeez, that\\'s the way it ought to \\nbe done.\\' So I really started patterning my material after him.\" \\nWarning! Do not contact big shots until you are ready. Look at all con\\xad\\ntacts as a one-shot deal—blow it and you don\\'t get a second chance. So \\nmake sure you are ready to give it your best shot. \\nPRO TAIK with Cindy Chupack, producer/writer \\n\"Sometimes when I\\'ve really critiqued a script the writer will say, \\'Can \\nI give it to you again after 1 do the rewrite?\\' Then it becomes this ongo\\xad\\ning job for me. When you give someone a script, that\\'s your one shot, \\nand just take whatever advice or critique they can give you. If they like \\nit, try to find out if there\\'s anybody else that they think you should \\nsend it to. But unless they offer to read a rewrite, don\\'t ask them to \\nread it a second time.\" \\nExercise: Six Degrees of Separation Game \\nAsk or e-mail all of your friends, relatives, acquaintances, and one-night \\nstands for any information about anybody that they might know in the \\nentertainment industry. Spend some time working on your approach so \\nyou seem professional. They might not know anyone but might know \\nsomeone who knows someone who knows someone. Any tip or introduc\\xad\\ntion will help. \\nGather your contacts and call them. Look at it this way. If you realty are that good, you\\'re doing them a favor, since discovering vou makes \\nthem look real good. \\nHave you ever been frightened to call up someone? Phone phobia is nor\\xad\\nmal. Sure, it\\'s easy when you\\'re making a request on someone else\\'s \\nbehalf, but self-promotion is hard. Yet you must make an attempt to build \\npersonal relationships with the movers and shakers in show business. \\nThat means you have to get off your ass and get on the phone—but don\\'t \\nbe an ass on the phone. \\nGetting Past the Secretary \\nThis is one of the weirdest ways I bypassed the secretary. \\nM£: This is fudy Carter. I would like to talk to Mr. Big Shot, please. \\nSECRETARY: Can I tell him what this is regarding? \\nME: I need to talk to him personally. It\\'s regarding his lab test results. \\nFaster than I could say \"herpes,\" I was on the phone with Mr. Big \\nShot. But misrepresenting yourself can open a whole other can of worms. \\nHonesty is the best policy. \\nHere are some tips on calling the big shots, from my publicist and \\nfriend Michelle Marx: \\n• Don\\'t go barging into people\\'s offices. \"Hello, Security?\" \\n• Don\\'t be overly annoying. \\n• Remember that everyone\\'s very busy. If someone doesn\\'t pay attention \\nto you, don\\'t take it personally. Realize they are busy or don\\'t care—yet. \\nDon\\'t get bent out of shape and mail them a dead rat just because they \\ndidn\\'t return your twenty phone calls. You might not have a life, but \\nthey do. \\n• Be pleasantly persistent. Keep up a stream of e-mails, press releases, fly\\xad\\ners, anil faxes, but make sure they are professional, to the point, and \\nfriendly. Then give the people freedom to respond in their own lime, \\neven if it does take a couple of years. At least you are getting your name \\nout there. • If you catch them and they arc busy, gel oft the phone and leave them \\nalone. Yon don\\'t want to get a negative image. \\n• I lave your six-degrees-of-separation person call the big shot first and rave \\nabout you. If your contact won\\'t do that but said that you can use her \\nname, then use it all that you can. that contact—who is the second \\ncousin of your ex-boyfriend, who lives around the block from your high \\nschool algebra teacher—is not just an acquaintance but your best friend. \\n\"Hello, my name is Joe Nobody and I was referred by my good friend \\nSusie Somebody. I believe that Mr. Big Shot is expecting nay call.\" \\n• And finally, to get to Ms. or Mr. Big Shot, become best friends with the \\nsecretary. Treat all secretaries as if they are the most important people in \\nthe world, because at this point in your career, they are. All showbiz sec\\xad\\nretaries are moguls in training. It\\'s to their benefit if they find the next \\nbig comedy Star and bring her to their boss\\'s attention. \\nFinding the Right Agent \\nTrying to find the right business agent, manager, or producer for your \\ncareer is as difficult as marrying the right person. There has to be chem\\xad\\nistry. Not everyone will like you. When 1 first attempted to get an agent \\nfor my first book—Stund-up Comedy: The Book (Dell Books, 1989)—1 was \\nrejected by everyone. And 1 do mean everyone. They all told me the same \\nthing: \"This book has too narrow a focus.\" But I found an out-of-work \\nbook agent in my Weight Watchers meeting who liked the project. She \\nsubmitted it to every publisher and it was rejected by everyone—except \\none. The book is currently in its seventeenth priming and has had a shelf \\nlife of over twelve years. It only takes one person. You have to find that \\none person. \\nBefore you approach an agency, research the company. Know every\\xad\\nthing about them—their clients, their successes, their failures. Not every\\xad\\none is right for you and you have to know which agents will represent \\nvour \"brand.\" PRO TALK with Bruce Smith, president of Omni pop Agency \\n\"Mv preference is for them [comics] to approach us knowing as much \\nabout the company as possible. I am flattered and immediately become \\nstupid. \\'Gee, 1 had no idea you knew so much about us ... \\' I\\'m just \\nga-ga that somebody actually did their homework. Half the time, peo\\xad\\nple send out form letters, head shots, and tapes to a million places, and \\nthere\\'s nothing personal about it. It\\'s like a hooker offering to sleep \\nwith you.\" \\nExercise: Selling Yourself to an Agency \\nBefore you pitch yourself to a manager or an agent, you need to see your\\xad\\nself as they do—a commodity. In this exercise, you are going to recreate \\nan agency\\'s staff meeting where they decide on new clients. \\nGather four or five friends and have them pretend to be agents at a \\nstaff meeting. You\\'re going to pretend to be an agent as well, someone \\nwho just saw your act or read your material, and you\\'re going to pitch \\nwin fellow agents should sign you up. It could sound like this: \"1 just saw \\nthis comic who is doing some very edgy material that really appeals to a \\nyoung audience. A lot of his material is about being a high school teacher \\nand I can sec sending him out on the club circuit to develop his material \\nand then cashing in on him in a sitcom—sort of a cross between Friends \\nand Welcome Bock, Kotter.\" \\nHave your fellow agents ask questions about this prospective client, \\nsuch as \\n• I low are you going to make money with him/her? \\n• What is his/her vision of where he/she wants to go? \\n• What\\'s his/her overall attitude? \\nIf you find it hard to pitch yourself, you might find it easier to start \\nthis exercise by pitching someone who is established. If you just saw a new \\ncomic named Robin Williams, how would you go about pitching him? \\nWhat to Do When You Get a Big Shot on the Phone \\nWhen speaking to Mr. Important Person Who Can Change the Course of \\nYour Career, do vou ever feel stupid? When you get off the phone do you want to slam your head into a trash compactor? Then before yon ciial \\nthat number, you better plan what you\\'re going to say after \"hello.\" \\nCarter\\'s 7 Steps to Successful Negotiations \\n1. When you call a VIP, have a short and winy introduction of who you are \\nand what you want, mentioning the person who recommended you. Prac\\xad\\ntice with a friend before you make the call. Do not make any big requests \\nat this point, such as, \"I want you to sign me to your agency.\" You can \\nsay, \"I want people such as yourself to be aware of what I\\'m doing \\nbecause I\\'m looking for representation.\" Or, \"I\\'m looking to get into the \\npub or club circuit.\\'\\' \\n2. Ask them, \"What are your concerns?\" This will create an opening for \\nthem to give vou the negatives, which is important information for vou \\nto have. \\n3. Repeat their concerns to them. Never defend, and never address their \\nconcerns. Instead, mirror them. For instance, let\\'s say Big Shot says, \\n\"There isn\\'t a lot of work for women in your age range.\" It\\'s very difficult \\nnot to take this sort of comment personally, but rather than defending \\nyourself, mirror their concern back to them. \"So, you don\\'t think there \\nare jobs in my age range? Is that what you mean?\" Resist the temptation \\nto defend (\"Rut there are a lot of women getting work in my age group\"). \\nEveryone wants to be heard and taken seriously. Very often, once some\\xad\\none really believes that you\\'ve heard what they said, their concern van\\xad\\nishes. If you can truly mirror someone\\'s concerns back to them it makes \\nyou powerful—as long as vou do it without whining, crying, or defend\\xad\\ning. By the way, this also works well with any relationship. Go for com\\xad\\nplete understanding first. \\n4. Empty them of their concerns. \"Do you have any other concerns?\" \"I\\'m \\nvery busy now and have a stack of papers on my desk and don\\'t even \\nhave time to look at new people.\" And mirror those concerns back, \"I get \\nthat you are an extremely busy person.\" \\n5. Only after you have emptied Mr. Big Shot of his concerns do you \\nrephrase what you want, taking into consideration their concerns. \"I get that \\nyou are very busy. I could send you my short, eight-minute video, which \\nwould knock your socks off. Then, if you want to see more, I could send \\nvou the longer one. I find that there is a large market for what I do, espe\\xad\\ncially because I\\'m getting a buzz from my weekly radio show and mv col\\xad\\numn in the Pasadena Weekly.\" \\n6. (io in for a request. Make this a small request. \"Would you be willing to watch my video?\" \"Can I put vou on the com]) list for my show?\" It \\nwould not be appropriate to ask in an initial conversation, \"Will you rep\\xad\\nresent me?\" or, \"Would you invest in mv project?\" Go for something that \\ncan get an easy yes. \\n7. Make your request time and date specific: \"I will messenger my tape over \\nthis afternoon.\" Push for a specific time and date: \"How about if I call \\nyou on Friday at two P.M.?\\'\\' I low many times have you got off the phone \\nwith someone who sounded really enthusiastic and then nothing hap\\xad\\npened? You probably got a \"Hollywood no.\" Unless you get a time and \\ndate commitment for the next step, they might as well have said no. \\nHere is a real-world example where I used this technique and I went \\nfrom \"concerns\" to signed contract in fifteen minutes. \\nIt was a job for a one-hour concert at a women\\'s business group in \\nSacramento. They liked my tape, but were dragging their feet about book\\xad\\ning me. \\nThese were Ms. Big Shot\\'s concerns: \"|udy, we like what you do but \\nquite frankly, last time we had a comic, we really didn\\'t have a very big \\nturnout.\" \\nI mirrored her. \"So, you\\'re concerned that you\\'re not going to get a \\nbig turnout and you\\'re not going to sell tickets. Is that right?\" \\n\"Yes, it is.\" \\n\"Any other concerns?\" \\n\"Well, we lost, quite frankly, we lost money last time.\" \\nI said, \"Oh, how much money did you lose?\" \\nAnd she said, \"Well, we came out about seven hundred and fifty dol\\xad\\nlars short.\" \\n\"OK, got it. Any other concerns?\" \\n\"No, that\\'s it.\" \\nI then repitched, taking into consideration her concerns: \"Well, in \\ngetting people to come, I can supply you with all the postcards and flyers \\nplus a list of the places where they should be put. And how many people-\\ndid you have come to the show\\' last year?\" \\n\"Five hundred people.\" \\n\"So, you had five hundred people come, and how much did the comic \\ncharge you?\" \\n\"The comic charged us last year fifteen hundred dollars.\" \\n1 said, \"And you lost seven-fifty.\" \\nShe said, \"Yes.\" \\nI said, \"I\\'ll tell you what . . . how about if I charge you seven hundred and fifty dollars less, so that if you have the exact same number of people \\ncome this year, you won\\'t lose anv money? So, I will only ask you for a \\nguarantee of seven hundred and fifty dollars. Anything above and beyond \\nthat, I will take eighty percent of the door. Do you agree to this?\" \\n\"Yes, I agree.\" \\nI faxed her a contract and within fifteen minutes, I had a signed con\\xad\\ntract. \\nThis way, 1 addressed her concerns, creating a win-win situation \\nwhere she knew that she would not take a loss no matter what. End \\nresult—the concert was totally sold out and I came away with 80 percent \\nof the door, amounting to $2,700 for my show. Both of us ended up \\nextremely happv. \\nThe Hollywood No \\nIn 1 lollywood no one wants to blow someone oil, because down the line, \\nthey might end up being a big star. You need to understand the dynamics \\nol (he Hollywood no. It someone says, \"I\\'d love to watch your tape,\" but \\nyou can never get them on the phone again, most likely you\\'ve been given \\na Hollywood no. Stop calling them, but still pursue these people by keep\\xad\\ning them in your information loop via e-mail and faxes. You never know \\nwhen a Hollywood no will turn into a Hollywood maybe somewhere \\ndown the line. \\nPRO TALK with fudi Brmvn, talent coordinator for U.S. Comedy Arts Festival \\n(Aspen) \\n\"If somebody shows an interest in you, keep in contact with them. \\nSend them a lhank-you card.

You never know when they might have something for you.\" \\nNegotiating for yourself doesn\\'t have to be a traumatic experience if you \\nuse the seven-step negotiation formula above. \"Wlien someone wants me for a gig, how do I figure out what to charge \\nthem?\" \\nThere is no one right price for a gig. At the beginning of your career \\ndon\\'t expect more than a burger. But if you are making people laugh and are \\nfairly clean, someone will soon ask you how much you would charge to do \\nyour act at their event or to write something for them. Don\\'t talk money \\nuntil vou\\'re clear on what exactly it is they need and what their budget is. \\n1. Ask them what they want you to do before talking money and get them \\nto be specific. If they say. \"I want you to perform at a roast for my dad,\" \\nquestions should include \\n• —How much time do you want me to do? \\n• —Do you want me to also MC? \\n• —Do you want me to write custom material? \\n2. Ask them, \"What is your budget?\" \"We can give you $500.\" \"My usual \\nfee is $750. How firm are you? I low about meeting me halfway? Do you \\nhave a budget to pay for my writing and MCing fees?\" \\n\\'3. If they won\\'t budge on the money, go for some perks—not stock options, \\nbut small perks. If they won\\'t give you more money, maybe they will give \\nyou an extra dinner for a friend, a hotel room, gas money, a hooker. \\n4.

And just as you want to have many \\nhits off one setup, you want to roll that one job into many. \\n1. Promote everv job that you have. Club owners love comics who bring in \\ncustomers. Inform the booker in writing of all the work that you are \\ndoing to promote the gig. \\n2. Book a return engagement before you leave. Even if it\\'s a year away, don\\'t \\nleave without getting back into their calendar. 3. Request a \"happy letter\" from them to include in your PR kit. Make sure \\nyou send a SASE for dieir convenience. Sometimes after working at a cor\\xad\\nporate event, I get e-mailed compliments from people in the audience. I \\nthen ask them to fax me their blank stationery and permission to reprint \\ntheir praises on (heir stationery to include in my PR kil. \\n4. Ask for referrals. If you did a good job for someone, ask them if they have \\nany associations, friends, clients, and so on who would enjoy your act. \\n5. When performing out of town, send local agents, speaker bureaus, and \\ncollege bookers free tickets to your show and schmooze with them after\\xad\\nward. \\n6. Write at least one thank-you note a week to the people in vour life—your \\nfamily, your friends, and that person on the street who gave you a quarter \\nfor the parking meter when you didn\\'t have any change. Then move that \\nappreciation to the people in your career. That agent who got you a job, \\nthe waitress who took the time to give you feedback on your act, the sec\\xad\\nretary who took the time to give you an address where to send your tape. \\nThe more you appreciate what you have, the more you will have. I am \\nmentoring a fifteen-year-old high school student who has a lot of reasons \\nto be resentful about her lot in life. She has no father and lived in one \\nroom in a motel in Compton with her four siblings and her mother, who \\nwas on welfare. By writing one thank-you note a week, she went from a \\nwhiner to a winner. Sometimes she\\'s had to scour a dismal week to find that \\none person. But no matter how bad things were, when she looked hard \\nenough, there was always someone to thank. She told me how people \\nresponded to her notes of appreciation: \"They cry with happiness.\" She has \\nlearned a very important lesson in life—to get it, you have to give it. \\nPRO TALK mtli fudi Broivn, manager \\n\"A good friend of mine, George Lopez, just walked out of a comedy \\nclub with thirty-five thousand dollars. It was all about him building the \\n[HispanicJ market, building the price in the market, and continuing to \\ncome back to a comedy club every six months. Find your market and \\ndo everything to promote yourself because club owners will continue to \\nreward you if you can prove that you are a draw. Even if you\\'re featur\\xad\\ning [middle act], if you sell tickets and bring people into the club, the \\nclub owner will reward you and in years to come you could find your\\xad\\nself cutting eighty percent door deals.\" You want to gel noticed? Notice others. II I did it all over again, one thing \\nI would do differently would be to connect more and be more giving to \\nothers. When I started out, I was self-absorbed, needy, and insecure. \\nGood qualities for comedy, bad lor friendships. I viewed other comics as \\nmy competition rather than as my comrades. I didn\\'t help them with \\ntheir acts; I hoarded my audition tips as well as my accolades. 1 wasn\\'t a \\nbitch, I was just scared. Or maybe I was both. \\nEnergy needs to flow from the comic to the audience. They\\'ve paid \\nfor you to give it to them. So many comics are so desperate (or attention \\nand jobs that they become energy vampires on and off the stage. They are \\nlooking outside themselves for fulfillment and compliments. Some even \\nneed the audience to give energy to them. But if a comic comes onto a \\nstage or into an office needing, they will not get anything. And even if they \\ndo get something, it will never be enough. Have you ever had a great set \\nbut your focus was on the one sour face in the second row? \\nI learned on one cold, snowy New York night that taking the time to \\nnotice others is the key to real success. \\nI was die opening act at New York\\'s Bottom Line for the Roches, a \\nband that was on Saturday Night Live a lot. The audience was full of show\\xad\\nbiz VIPs who schmoozed and talked loudly while I was onstage. I made \\nsome jokes about it to the civilians in the first row, but the big shots con\\xad\\ntinued to talk during my act. And if that wasn\\'t bad enough, when I got \\noffstage I found out that the club owners had let these VIPs in and kept \\nni)- seventy-five-year-old aunt Edith and her family standing in the snow \\noutside. I went backstage in a fury. A woman asked me, \"What\\'s the mat\\xad\\nter, honey?\" I burst out crying. She pulled me into a small backstage \\nbathroom. This complete stranger sat on the toilet in this tiny New York \\ncockroach-infested bathroom, holding me on her lap while 1 sobbed on \\nher shoulder. \"That\\'s OK, honey. I know how hard it can be.\" When I \\nlooked up I realized, \"Oh my God, you\\'re Gilda Radner.\" At that time. \\nGilda was a big star on Saturday Night Live. She was there to introduce the \\nband, but took the time to care for a complete stranger. Gilda Radner \\ndied of ovarian cancer in 1989. How do you want to be remembered? Some of (he people reading \\nibis book will become stars, be written about, and be the butt of other \\ncomics\\' jokes. But sometimes it\\'s the little moments, when we take the \\ntime to recognize others, that we truly are a superstar. '"

      "QUESTION:\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "ANSWER:\"<think>\n",
      "Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this question using the provided context. The user has given me several paragraphs about Chris ROCK and some advice from Bruce Smith on how to stand out as a comic character. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me read through each paragraph carefully. The first one talks about Chris ROCK trying to sell crack by mentioning that he's never heard of drug dealers going to get rid of all the crack in his house. Then there are three PRO TALKs with Bruce Smith, discussing how comics should stand out and creating slogans for their personas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second paragraph seems to be a repetition or maybe an error because it starts again with Chris ROCK but uses different wording. I'll skip that since it's redundant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third paragraph is similar to the first one, talking about Chris ROCK again and then three PRO TALKs from Bruce Smith. \n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth paragraph also repeats Chris ROCK in a slightly different way and includes more PRO TALKs from Bruce Smith.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, all the context provided seems to focus on Chris ROCK's quotes and advice from Bruce Smith on how to stand out as a comic character. The main points are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Chris ROCK is frustrated with drug dealers who try to get rid of crack in his house.\n",
      "2. Bruce Smith emphasizes that comics should stand out by creating slogans for their personas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question isn't explicitly stated, but I think the user wants an answer based on these context snippets. Maybe they're asking about how to write a joke using specific elements like topic, attitude, premise, act-out, and mix. Alternatively, it could be about Bruce Smith's advice or Chris ROCK's quotes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I should consider what each part of the question refers to. If the user is asking for help writing a joke, then I can provide an example based on the context provided. If it's about Bruce Smith's advice, I can explain how he suggests creating slogans. Alternatively, if it's about Chris ROCK's quotes, I can discuss his frustration with drug dealers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the context doesn't specify exactly what the user needs help with, but given that the PRO TALKs are about standing out as a comic character, maybe the answer is about Bruce Smith's advice on creating slogans for personas. Alternatively, if it's about writing a joke using specific elements, I can provide an example.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the most likely scenario is that the user wants help with writing a joke using the context provided, perhaps focusing on the topic of comics standing out. So, I'll go with that and provide an example based on Bruce Smith's advice.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "To stand out as a comic character, it's essential to create a slogan that reflects your persona clearly. For instance, if you're known for your humor, you might use something like \"The Last Time I Saw You, There Was a Message Attached.\" This phrase captures the essence of your humor and sets a memorable tone.\"\n",
