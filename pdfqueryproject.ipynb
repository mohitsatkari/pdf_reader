      "The text starts with a statement about lottery tickets and how they have better odds of striking it rich compared to other lotteries. Then there are several paragraphs that talk about people getting jobs they didn't expect, including Conan O'Brien, who was replaced by Fritz Coleman on NBC's Late Night. There's also mention of Seinfeld being plucked from the stand-up circuit and working for Benson's sitcom at a salary of §4,000 a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think I might have missed something earlier. Let me check again. The text does say that Seinfeld was plucked from the stand-up circuit in 1980 to work for Benson's sitcom. So that must be where he worked. \n",
      "\n",
      "I remember hearing about Jerry Seinfeld being a comedian and host who did work on some popular sitcoms, but I'm not exactly sure of the details. From what I recall, he was known for his humor and sometimes his controversial views. He also had a successful career in comedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the text mentions that Seinfeld worked at Benson's sitcom, which is where he got his job after being plucked from the stand-up circuit. So based on this context, Jerry Seinfeld must have been working as KNBC's weatherman in 1980 before moving to other jobs.\n",
